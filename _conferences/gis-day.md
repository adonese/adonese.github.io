excerpt: G&I organized the first GIS Day event in Sudan. Invited speakers from wide variety of fields have had a huge impact on the success of the day. Students from different institutions from Khartoum (and other states) enjoyed the day and learned different ways to use GIS in their careers and study. We also managed to schedule two webinars--one was the author of gvSIG. In the next year we are willing to increase the number of the audience and include different parties e.g., high school students. We are also going to invest on expanding our program to include students and people from different states in Sudan. Any support or sponsor for this project is very welcomed.
