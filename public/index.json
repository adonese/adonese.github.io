So powerful yet so disastorous. And the fate o the fate, fate is so good at ridculing our hopes and promises, and tearing apart our loved ones. I have this thing where i firmly believe if you declare, you are at a higher risk it won\u0026rsquo;t happen. But I\u0026rsquo;m stepping up this time. Not though as much to challenge fate, but just to ask for forgiveness that i shall declare my love. I find so much beauty to spread out love than just keeping it a secret between the two lovers. The blockade on love is next to a war against humanity. Then why on earth humanity always have always had weddings, don\u0026rsquo;t you think? To showoff and celebrate love.\nBut I always keep reminding myself if it is too obvious, the hindsight is mostly flawed. You have your signficant other too to comply with and you have the societal norms and so many arbitrarily laws just made to organize the process of humain intercourse but what they had eventually contributed to is an indenture to make love legal.\nI argue though that love is by design is an outlaw. Love can never be lawful, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t either in the hindsight. Love cannot be constrained, cannot have deeds and certificates, cannot be conformed to norms: IT SHOULDN\u0026rsquo;T. Or else you are at a risk of conforming to a normal distribution and fitting what everyone\u0026rsquo;s there. By this age, I\u0026rsquo;m still struggling to understand how love works. In absolute terms, I feel one can love anyone no exceptions. But what I\u0026rsquo;m leaning to recently is that a good love story is where you love your partner and love yourself, simultaneously.\nI would say a good love is the one that takes you through a journey and accelerate your process to better understand yourself, love yourself and be in content with what you have. Ultimately, it helps you to navigate through the challenges that life through at you while still fueling you to push further and to realize your true potential and expand the terrotries of what you have once thought are the only horizons for your passion.\nLove comes in unique shapes and flavors and every one of them will expose you to different aspects of yourself: to different doors in your life.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2023-04-27-oh-love/","summary":"O love o life and the question of the spirit.

Our company aims to provide innovative and convenient solutions for e-payment using cards and POS devices. We believe that we have the right product and the right product-market-fit and we have a solid niche to operate on. However, we also face many challenges and obstacles in our journey to grow and scale our business in the Sudanese market.\nOne of the key factors\nCBOS or Central Bank of Sudan mostly is concerned about the policies and ensuring that we comply with them. They set the rules and regulations for e-payment in Sudan and monitor the performance and security of the system. They also issue licenses for fintech companies like ours to operate in the market. We respect their role and authority and we always try to follow their guidelines and requirements.\nThe banks, however, are very tricky. Banks are working within the current setup as our direct competitors yet at the same time a huge part of our business depends on them: we cannot issue and create merchants unless with a prior approval from a bank and that must happen for each merchant (imagine the whole financial system is still after all of these steps is still bottlenecked by how banks operate).\nBanks don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of incentives either to help in the POS nor the cards: they don\u0026rsquo;t get any fees! They do a lot of \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; but none of it really translates into any tangible revenue to the bank. They see us as a threat to their traditional banking services and they try to limit our growth and expansion by imposing high fees, delays, and restrictions on us.\nThe whole e-payment in Sudan therefore operates within the velocity and agility that is set by the banks. All of the benefits of fintech companies are useless within this setup, since fintechs in Sudan are semi-autonomous in the most crucial aspects and extremely tied to the banks (their direct competitors) when it comes to achieving any of their business goals.\nThis is my journey and findings with e-payment in Sudan and without intervention from CBOS the situation will only keep getting worse. I hope that CBOS will recognize the potential and value of fintech companies like ours and will create a more enabling and supportive environment for us to thrive and contribute to the development of the financial sector in Sudan.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2023-03-27-state-of-fintech/","summary":"My Experience with E-Payment in Sudan: Challenges and Opportunities I am a cofounder and CTO of a fintech startup company operating in Sudan.

Abstractions should be reached through natural system\u0026rsquo;s evolution. There are also economical aspects, we don\u0026rsquo;t have that luxury in Sudan to be fully dedicated for open source.\nIt came to my mind two examples when talking about open source in Sudan:\nKunafa, a web framework built on kotlin https://github.com/narbase/kunafa and noebs: an open source payment gateway https://github.com/adonese/noebs kunafa Kunafa aims to replace the rather fragmented web development experience with a unified framework. It is pretty much Django for kotlin. Narbase (the company behind it) is one of well known software houses in Sudan. And they are using it for various projects within their company.\nnoebs Full disclosure: I\u0026rsquo;m the author of noebs and also main maintainer. Noebs dates back to 2018, my goal for noebs was to experiment with an API that seamlessly works for all of EBS (the national switch) fragmented APIs. That goal was challenged over the year, but since our first Central Bank of Sudan license approval (2019), all of noebs public apis have not changed!\nI would like to highlight our experience with noebs. noebs https://github.com/adonese/noebs is an open source payment gateway. It serves as a nice abstraction layer on top of Sudan\u0026rsquo;s National Switch System (EBS). Noebs is being used in production for more than 3 years now (the earliest being 2019), and it is still under active development! It has been used by various organizations of different sizes: fintech companies, NGOs, and small to mid enterprises (notes: we failed to make any good impression on Big Corporations, they either don\u0026rsquo;t understand what an open source is, or it is a big red flag for them.)\nI think we need more open source projects, the market does really need that.

This is a crazy amount! BoK doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a purchase API, people use P2P feature in BoK app to make purchases! The payment is done by simply asking the merchant for their BoK account number, enter the account number, make the payment and then show a result page to the merchant! BoK relies heavily on the ease of payment to accelerate its growth. You simply just ask the other person about their BoK account number (it is 7 digits, auto increment number), and yeah viola, the payment is done. What could possibly go wrong. A LOT, actually.\nBut, let\u0026rsquo;s see how the payment flow works in BoK.\nyou can have a BoK account by visiting a nearby bank branch of bank of khartoum, and from there you can create a bank account which will also automatically creates an account in their BoK app you can transfer to BoK users by asking them about their BoK account number, it is a 7-digits, auto-increment counter (starts at 1,000,000 (or 1 million)) having someone\u0026rsquo;s account number, will allow you (as a BoK user) to retrieve the following info: their full-name their bank branch, the place where the originally created their BoK if you want to transfer money to someone, you will just have to ask them about their BoK account number, the app will first fetches the account info from the server (check previous step) which includes their name and the bank branch that the account was created after that, you enter the amount and proceed and a result screen will be shown for you. The screen has three states: orange, denotes the transaction is pending green, the transaction has completed successfully red, the transaction failed there\u0026rsquo;s also a transaction history, where from the app you can click on history to check the status of the previous transactions (we call it in Sudan, the white screen, not to be confused by the previous three screens) It didn\u0026rsquo;t take too much time before someone actually made a frauduelent replica of the app!\nwhat happen when a fraud occurs Fraud will inevitably happen, and it is happening. We have two cases:\neither you sent amount to a wrong beneficiary (remember account numbers were auto-increment) or, someone claiming to send you a money, while they actually didn\u0026rsquo;t.

Agile is quite reasonable and intutitive if you think about it. It allows you to gracefully fail and call your failures next sprint. That\u0026rsquo;s a huge potential if it was unlocked properly. We start with an MVP and then we We divide deliverables into software development cycles and at each cycle we tackle this very well defined set of problems. The epic of our performance should fix as many issues and implement as many tasks. That works magic! But it has its drawbacks 1.\nBut what if\nFocusing too much on smaller tasks will eventually diverge teams from the bigger pictures, developers\u0026rsquo; focus will be around completing a sprint than actually understanding what users really want.

That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of years especially in Sudan, software are rather dropped quickly.\nwhat is noebs? noebs is an open source payment gateway. Currently it implements all of EBS services, it supports both EBS Merchant Web Services and Consumer Web Services. It also comes with a built-in support for the new Dynamic Fees model. We also support QR services and the new Merchant Web APIs. In that, I know of none that actually have such thorough level of coverage and actively being developed. So yaaay to us!\nnoebs v1 We are not there yet, I wish I could say that, but we are not there yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s get back a bit and understand what we were initially thinking of when we started this project.\nwe want to change the payment landscape Originally, noebs was meant to act as a unified payment gateway for all of EBS services. However, we realized that we need to separate the services into different sets: consumer and merchant. They vary slightly in terms of fields, but we made a good progress into fixing that.\nWe wanted to both be compatible with EBS APIs, and at the same time make a unified interface for their two rather varying APIs.\nThat doesn\u0026rsquo;t really work at all in practice: we had to make a tradeoff, either sticking to EBS APIs or building a shim layer on top of it. We opted to become fully compatible with EBS.\nthe database I hated this part the most. We were using gorm v1 and the SQL code we wrote was ribbish. One of the biggest changes we introduced was upgrading to Gorm v2. At least, we now at least migrated to gorm v2. I\u0026rsquo;m less embarrassed now.\nnoebs API noebs APIs have been stable since the first release in 2019. We have not changed any API since then. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we will change that status. Though we should.\nAPI improvements So far, we don\u0026rsquo;t manage sessions or authentication. We are delegating this task to the consumer of noebs to deploy however authentication system they like. I still feel this is the right way of doing things. There are infinite ways of rolling out an authentication server, and in certain cases, payment companies, hide their authentication server behind a VPN. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we will change anything about that, at least not in the public noebs repo.\nSecurity We are yet to perform an auditing in noebs. It is expensive to be honest and we are relying EBS tests we have passed to be our security baseline.\nareas that need improvement Fix our gRPC layer, it helps a lot in integrating with noebs Complete our SDKs: we have Java, Dart, and JS, but we need to add more languages especially WordPress and PHP and their plugins. Unit testing noebs is a non-trivial task and it needs to be done before we can claim we have a noebs V1 product\u0026hellip; But that is challenging. But, what i really want to address is the deployment..\nnoebs deployment Currently, noebs is only as useful as the connectivity of EBS is up. If e.g., EBS QA merchant server is down, we are on our own. I have been vocally reluctant to add mocking endpoints to noebs source code. It will just make the whole code messy, and will make it far more harder to document the code. The code will be hard to maintain. I don\u0026rsquo;t like that approach.\nIdeally, what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of is of this sort:\ngraph TD D[local]--Accessible--\u0026gt; A D-.Not accessible.-\u0026gt;B D==VPN?==\u0026gt;B A[noebs] --\u0026gt;|VPN| B(EBS Endpoints) A[noebs]--\u0026gt; H(Redis) B --\u0026gt; F{fa:fa-laptop EBS Consumer} B --\u0026gt; G{fa:fa-server EBS Merchant} We don\u0026rsquo;t have an access to EBS directly, and as a result it is rather difficult to perform any integration tests.

Tech companies emphasized their own revenue over making the humanity better \u0026ndash; errr making its users better. And those incentives don\u0026rsquo;t align with what the actual users want.\nFor example, a keyboard software. Let\u0026rsquo;s say google\u0026rsquo;s GBoard. It is fantastic, it is smart enough to predict and corrects their typing mistakes. That is wonderful, amazing!\nBut at what cost? Every keystroke you hit is being logged, internally at least. In a storage in your own device that you might not exactly have access to it. Even if you have, it is still scary. Google\u0026rsquo;s own algorithms mention that they will never include User\u0026rsquo;s Identifiable Information as they are trying to make insights from our typing. That\u0026rsquo;s correct however.\nBefore that, let us make this simple category for our stakeholders:\nWe have the users (you, and me) The platform owners (Facebook, Google, etc) And the ads companies. By ads companies we mean companies that sell ads, or wanted to increase their product\u0026rsquo;s users by getting new users via Facebook and Google. what is personally identifiable information? In layman terms, it is your personal details. That could be your passport, your phone number, your email, or even your device ID (and yes, every phone device has its own unique ID provided by the OS, whether that was Apple or Android). Personally Identifiable information are of a huge value since they allow for targeted ads.\nTargeted ads are a natural progression over what we used to have back then. Ads were random and they would popup everywhere \u0026ndash; quite annoying. But, we thought that if we were able to somehow identify our user\u0026rsquo;s preferences by linking their internet surfing behaviours to ours, we can have a better understanding for what that specific user likes. And we put an emphasis on the specific user part. Facebook gained massive amount of money because it allows their ads companies partners to get a fine grained result and can target on behalf (this is very important) potenial customers. Let\u0026rsquo;s see again how that works, how it used to work and the current situation:\nPreviously:\nan ads company will approach Google (a platform that has potentially huge userbase) it will ask google to place ads banners on their website (which is google\u0026rsquo;s search page) and google will charge them against the number of the banners that google had shown. It was simple, annoying indeed but harmless. There was no AI there, no psychologist, just fucking annoying sex toys. That was the whole internet pre Facebook was. It had to improve however, cause google wanted to maximize money. So they started with showing relevant ads. And whenever a relevancy criteria is being used, your data is being logged. Scary, but not verily. Google wanted to gain more money by telling ads companies: hey we noticed that you paid us $1000 to show your ads, but only 3 users have clicked into those banners. What if we told you that we can increase the number of users that click into your ads? IMMENSE!\nClick through Rate (CtR) Basically this one measures how many users have actually clicked into your link, into your ad. It is important because it solves the first problem that ads companies face: they don\u0026rsquo;t know how many users are actually interested in said ads. And it also allowed platform owners to gain further money as they now offering what Telecom ppl calls Value Added. They are not just exploiting you to a new customer base, Ni. They also have insights that can better aim your campaigns. And make no mistake that platform owners are extremely defensive against their users\u0026rsquo;: they will never allow you to have raw data over their users, but will relay whatever ads you want to whomever they see fit to receive this ads.\nConversion Rate (CR) CR is rather an amazing concept and a huge improvement over what we used to have earlier. Rather than telling you how many users have actually clicked on that link, they can also give you details about how many users have actually converted. Signed up to your website, or made a purchase or whatever. CR is the most important term ever since it gives a direct indicator of your marketing campaign and its effectiveness.\nIt scares me that in order to get a correct spelling, better grammar, i will have to use an ADs company app that will record my keystrokes and record all of the worlds\u0026rsquo; keystrokes so i can spell Entreprneurship correctly.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2022-05-09-technology-is-scary/","summary":"Technology scares me, and don\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on how AI and that crazy shit have serious consequences that we are not adapted, that we have not considered at all.

For me this one is really super important, since i would never in earth want to lose her as a friend. it is just a big NO..\nSo, what is my problem. One way of looking is the failure to get back to just being friends and the embarrassment that follows. i get that.\nAnother reason is that people often shows their feelings in some sort of a transactional matter: i show my intimacy and care, for you to fall in love with me. So, effectively, the amount of their caring, their emotions and their friend-liness is all for an anticipated reward in the future (eg. the other party loving you back). This behavior is quite common.\ni feel like love was never meant to be understood. if life in general is that complex, i would wonder how a magnificint thing such as love can be understood lest be measured. the way we treat our feelings as a gauge that goes up and down is just ridicluous. but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t answer the question at all, or help me just yet. However, in another way, trying to use reasoning in order to solve for my social or emotional issues might not be the best route. But some questions might make for a great lifetime quest.\nAs i\u0026rsquo;m living through this, i learned to always come forth: be very clear about my expectations of a relationship and if i ever felt a term in the contract might be violated from my side, i would relay that change to other person so they know what is in my mind. for example, i grow feelings towards a friend, but we are just friends. it is important to show your feelings since they are valuable and they need to be listened, but it is even more important to be clear about that.\nMaybe i will add more to this text some time in the future\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2021-10-22-a-date/","summary":"Just to confirm: i have dated before, i kinda did the whole process so i\u0026rsquo;m very well familar with how dates are practically been conducted.

Also hiring\u0026rsquo;s nuts. i have listened to Mohamed Mudather\u0026rsquo;s video about hiring (Kutti is the CEO of Orooma, popular recruitment company in Sudan). One of the things he mentioned:\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t have to have your guy at said company to hire you and companies are struggling to recruit candidates. So, if that was the case, then why engineers and even great ones are struggling to get hired? Well, Kutti noted companies hire based on internal recommedations, like let\u0026rsquo;s discuss tech companies and how the process usually work (from my own experience and some empirical observations):\na team (usually 2 or 3) is working on some product or feature they stuck in something and they want to hire someone it is often the case the company would hire based on the team\u0026rsquo;s recommendations, NOT their HR dep. it is also extremely VERY rare in startup companies to even have an HR. The team is one to decide whom to recruit. For example, i had some managerial roles at several companies for the last couple of years and i don\u0026rsquo;t recall any time where we recruited someone from HR. It\u0026rsquo;s always the case we ask through our circle for available developers. I want to call it a Search Space problem: we are searching for candidates through very narrow window, be it our friends, our colleagues, etc.\ntech hiring is a broken practice i hate interviews, when i interview someone or when i get interviewed. i suck at both. And frankly i would argue this is not the best way to assess one\u0026rsquo;s skills. It is extremely very difficult to talk about your previous works or about your skills. Lots of great engineers i chatted with cannot actually talk about their skills. The verbal interview is just a mere SEO test: you get the ones who show up well, use buzzwords. You might not necessarily want to have those, they are rarely doers.\nWhiteboard tests are also not a good indicator. It implies an asynchronousy in the candidate: why would someone be prepared to give you promptly an answer. I never faced a problem where someone must act promptly, programming problems require thorough thinking and a structured process of sorting things out: if you, as a programmer, have to act promptly and always be correct, there is something severly wrong about your employer or team leads.\nwhat are we doin\u0026rsquo; at 2t i\u0026rsquo;m starting a new thing. We are still working on it, but at 2t i want to change a lot of things. honestly, i\u0026rsquo;m pissed at lots of things and i also got pissed off quite often so yeah 2t for me is a place where i want to make the world a little bit better.\nI made an offer to a junior developer without actually interviewing them. i mean, we did have an interview but it was regarding other parts like cultural fit and so. And that would have been our first hire. But, here are a few notes i made from the said candidate:\nthe candidate wrote us a really well thoughtful letter. Their email included: chonological order of their past experiences. Each entry included what they learned, the technologies they used, the challenges they faced and a link to github or any online resource to support that. That was just amazing. it made things for me extremely very clear and it was a no-brainer to make them an offer i read their email, read their resume, and looked them up. That might seem obvious but companies here rarely do it. The interviewers all seem to just read through the candidate\u0026rsquo;s resume during the interview. That sucks. That saved us and the candidate tons of time: we actually did our part, we read through the candidates resume, went to their github account and in addition to fetching their activities, i also downloaded the candidates project and read through the whole source code. THIS IS ACTUALLY MY JOB! I HAVE TO READ EVERY SOURCE CODE we have in the company especially now we are a very early startup. Case in point: yes you can hire without 3 interviews, and without a whiteboard test or the rest of the crap. The hiring process is severely broken and we ought to fix that.\nRecruiters: please just do your part and fucking read the candidates resume and look for their github indies: please try to make your resume look as professional as possible. Your attitude is extremely very important and being a nice person is a credit. have a github account, try to make it active and try to contribute to open source projects in addition to have your own side open source projects.

Aaaand we got this\n2021/06/01 06:35:50 http: Accept error: accept tcp [::]:6662: accept4: too many open files;\nThat is really seems awfully terrible! Now let me my dear friend walk you through this message:\nAccept error: well accept is a linux command that accepts network requests! It is that clear \u0026lt;insert_michael_scotts_that_is_as_clear_as_i_can_make_it_meme_here\u0026gt;. Ok, it basically says that hey dude i\u0026rsquo;m the linux, ooops the kernel i meant the thing that does your tcp networking and other shit? you know me? Here is the thing: i\u0026rsquo;m so overwhelmed dude and i cannot accept this request. Byyyyye! That is not super helpful aight? Like why cannot you accept connections? There are many reasons as to why accept won\u0026rsquo;t accept things:\nnetwork card stuff (i honestly don\u0026rsquo;t know the specifics, but i can only imagine there would be some) file descriptors others that are not relevant to our discussion right now, and i also cannot recall them We are going to discuss file descriptors only for the purpose of this post.\nSo what is a file descriptor or fd what the heck is that! I will use my own understanding to describe it and then go to the lovely linux journal to get an informed opinion.\nAny program is a process. And any process has a process id (so that the kernel can keep track of all running processes and better isolate and manage them). A file can be opened for reading from multiple processes. But it is never safe to have multiple processes writing to the same file. Or fid or fd. The terminology is quite confusing. And we all know that good \u0026lsquo;ol practice to always close the file after finish writing to it.\nSo basically: file descriptors help the kernel maps between an existing file and it is associated processes.\nNow, to the formal, rather informed definition of file descriptors:\nThe open() system call opens the file specified by pathname. (...) The return value of open() is a file descriptor, a small, nonnegative integer that is used in subsequent system calls (read(2), write(2), lseek(2), fcntl(2), etc.) to refer to the open file. The file descriptor returned by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process. (...) A call to open() creates a new open file description, an entry in the system-wide table of open files. (...) A file descriptor is a reference to an open file description; this reference is unaffected if pathname is subsequently removed or modified to refer to a different file. (...) I tried to only show the most relevant part, but still it ended up being lengthy. But to summarize that text:\nopen which is a syscall, when invoked, returns a non-negative number, and that what we call file descriptor file descriptor is remains unchanged and resilient to the source file changes, renames, etc. A snapshot at the invocation of open that only has the data at that time. Pretty dope if you asked me. and the last part is calling open creates a new entry for this particular fd in the system-wide table of open files! WOW! What have we learned! System. Wide. Table. Of. Open. Files. So the kernel keeps track of every existing current open file. Now one thing i know about systems is that whenever you keep track of things, you impose limits! You cannot infinitely increase that \u0026ldquo;existing open files tables\u0026rdquo; forever. That is just not how things work!\nSo, i know this command line called ulimit that shows \u0026ndash; but but, we will get back to it later.\nBack to our error message again:\n2021/06/01 06:35:50 http: Accept error: accept tcp [::]:6662: accept4: too many open files;\nNow we know about accept. [::]:6662 means that any incoming request to port 6662 (the internal port we are using). The error is accept4: too many open files.\nOk, we are getting some where with this. This error tells us that we have exceeded the maximum number of open files that the kernel allows us to have. Remember the table of all open files and that we said it has a cap? Well, you bet! We have exceeded that cap.\nNow, the first thing we gonna do is to check the number of our opened file descriptors to our process.\n$ lsof | awk \u0026#39;{ print $2 \u0026#34; \u0026#34; $1; }\u0026#39; | sort -rn | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10 So, this command is basically copied from SO, but to go through it quickly, here what it does. lsof is literally short for list of open files😂! This is the one we need. lsof results are like this:\nCOMMAND PID TID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME init 1 root cwd unknown 0 /proc/1/ We use awk to gret the second column PID and put a space and then the first column COMMAND. We sort and get the unqiue values and then sort them again and get only the top ten processes.\nUnsurprisingly, our program is the one with the most used open files! Panic! Or not VERY panic since we already identify the problem.\nlet us fix that I believe that there are three states in debugging: denial, anger, and acceptance.\nSo, we are leaking resources. We are not closing a file. Easy, we are only using files in two locations (or not?):\nwe store images in the file system we are using sqlite Simple. And easy to fix. We wrote in such a fine way that the database connection has a one handler, and the image is also has one handler that reads the base64 and dumps it into the file system (respecting their image encoding). But yeah, the problem is well cleared out. Database part was well clean actually and doesn\u0026rsquo;t leak any thing. Ha! The image part however doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually close the file at all! Simple fix just add defer image.Close() and the magic is done!\nAnd so i did. I deployed the change, restarted the go server and call it a day. Checked the admin page again and it works. Wow! That actually only took me a matter of minutes. But some thing telling me there is something wrong:\nafter i deployed the changes i restarted the server, which closes any existing connection and / or file buffers. That is not so cool? i didn\u0026rsquo;t get deeper into what these files are? I mean, i know (intuition, not informed, that they are in the memory and not flushed yet to the storage. We lost all of that.) That simple fix: is not tested doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain the root problem at all and it didn\u0026rsquo;t touch on the problem, like what these files are and why that happened! And that was the denial part. But nonetheless i deployed the fix, every thing back to working again, had a lovely chat with the crush and that is that.\nSo, just to challenge my other me, i went to the server several hours later (the electricity was conveniently off) and i was like ok dude let\u0026rsquo;s try and see if you gonna break again.\nIt did break again. Fuck it! This time i knew i had to go with the hard way and dig deeper (DEEPER SON!).\nLet us do the VERY simple solution: increase the maximum number of opened files. We can achieve that simply with:\n$ uname -n 9000 Notice that in linux systems, the default max is: 1024. We increased that and nope still we are well beyond that. Well, it turns out there are two modes:\nhard limit (at the kernel space) soft limit The user can only decrease the hard limit, but they cannot increase it. Whilst, the user is free to incr/decr the soft limit. We are interested in the hard limit thu. Increasing the hard limit does require a log out, and a new session (i was a bit lazy to do that), and the other thing: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help with the problem at all! It just delays it for another time.\nI had three thoughts:\nhttp connections open sockets and a socket is a file! we closed the image leakage but we still hit max opened files. We have only have one connection to the database (one fd), and now we always release image files. Things should work. Apparently things didn\u0026rsquo;t work, and we had to dig deeper. Let us investigate those opened files! Where are their paths and what the hell are they!\n$ ls -l /proc/620272/fd This command basically lists every file that under our process id (620272) \u0026ndash; can you tell where did we get our process id? That lists a whole lots of 10,000 files. Going deeper, we want to get even more details about all of those 10K files. What they link to, what are their paths, etc. And lsof for the win, yet again.\n$ lsof -i -a -p 620272 What it does is simply listing all of existing network files i for the process id -p. That is the whole thing.

And it is divided between two classes:\nCLOSE_WAIT ESTABLISHED We are leaking file descriptors through outgoing connections we make to an external service and stuck into establishing new ones (to the same external service). So ok why what why did that happen or even how? what does close wait means too? It actually roughly works like this (for close_wait case):\nwe send a request to the server the server receives it and responds back we are pending until the server replies to us we then close the connection, or in certain cases we employ http keep alive to better utilize an existing sockets between the two endpoints, and that help with the performance I\u0026rsquo;m gonna spare you the details of this, but basically close_wait is that the external service is awaiting us to tell it that we are finish with the connection and can safely close the socket (and so are us too). But that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen at all!\nNow, checking go\u0026rsquo;s standard library and check for the http client closing. Go\u0026rsquo;s http client surprisingly doesn\u0026rsquo;t employ timeouts (so weird), and the user is responsible for handling that. The fix for that is quite very simple, and it has two ways:\nfirst employ a timeout for timeouts for the http client so that when a connection error occurs (say their server is down), we don\u0026rsquo;t keep the socket open forever! second, and that is not usually needed, but after receiving a respond from the server, we manually close the connection from our side. It is just an extra step, but mostly not needed at all. Deployed the changes, restarted the server and viola everything works! We are getting back to sane file descriptors.\nWhat did we learn A lot. But i will write that some time later.\nThings go wrong. Always. Design for one things go wrong. The system we have been working on is quite very simple, but one thing that stood to me is that it helped a lot that the code was a bit tidy. I have not touched this code in months, and it sure paid back a lot to have those things arranged in a good way. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have a monitoring system in place and that is really scary. There should be an automated way to report all of the errors to its team. Testing is really important. This system was not exposed to a stress testing in any manner. It would have taken me about couple of hours and that would have saved us the pain of this whole debugging session It is important to test for the platform as well. Stuff like ulimit can only be reproduced in a real system (of course that is not the case with cloud providers such as PaaS).

Noebs is an open source payment gateway with large support and adoption from many corporations in Sudan. Our goal is to make payments secure and simple, and we want to do that super fast. To this end, we started rolling out our sdks. SDKs are fancy way of saying libraries, a code that others can import to interact with our services. Noebs sdk is derived from our code, and it is being used in prod for a while now. The code for all of these sdks are available here\nWhen started developing our sdk, we had these constraints:\nwe have to comply with payment regulation the code needs to be tested we want to offer a very simple api, developer can use in a matter of minutes: no try - catch: we believe that developers don\u0026rsquo;t properly handle try catch block and they log the error to the stderr instead type safe and that is derived from being try catch free We come up with this simple design:\nOne class Noebs Use of generics (or interfaces) Three types of Responses: Successful: for successful responses only PaymentError: for payment specific errors such as insufficient funds, etc Error: for generics errors such as fields errors, network timeouts, etc Every class of these classes has its own: isError(), isPaymentError() and isSuccessful() to get the appropriate messages for each response. We believe designing it this way is simple and straighforward to use. We also believe the explicit way of returning errors as part of the api, instead of relying on the consumer to handle them helps us avoid common pitfalls in programming.\nThe other part is our http client design. One of the unique goals behind noebs is to offer a unified api for ebs services. It took us a bit to oblige with that ourselves too.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how noebs works internally:\ntakes a request request has common fields we literally call them so in our code the only differences between say balance api and purchase api are extra fields for amount and destination, and change in the url (balance \u0026lt;=\u0026gt; purchase), we can use purchase api in balance api, and so on. We simply have a very big class that contains every field in noebs! They are not that much, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry. Our class, Request, has all the necessary fields that will be used by evert method in our SDK. marshalling internally excludes empty and null fields, and noebs does the same too. This way, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to have a per method class to contain the request data. This is a huge win and reduction in code. In fact the whole noebs-dart sdk only consists of 144 LOC for the logic part (and other 232 SLOC for the Request class)! And this includes documentations, empty lines, etc!\nWe have a private method called _api that serves as our http client for all noebs services.\nWriting code this way is easier for us to maintain, and easier for the library consumers too to use and they are comfortably know that everything is exposed to them, and they don\u0026rsquo;t need to trap panics through try catch block. We believe that many develoeprs simply ignore catch block and they opt to stderr it instead. Errors are first class citizens in noebs sdks and they are as important as successful responses, if not moreso.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2021-01-15-api-design/","summary":"This post serves as a walkthrough for noebs sdks.

And we are pretty much familiar with ip addresses, domain names and stuff, we type in google.com and we are welcomed with google search, and so on. This process is technically called http request. Http cause is the protocol that was used to make the request happens, protocol is really just a fancy way of saying \u0026ldquo;hey dude, umm can you tell me how are you going to send me your bytes\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;everythying is a byte.\nSo when we send a request, we send it to a server right? The server is really just a computer. Inside that server, one of the awesome guys like Hashim and co. will probably have a web server. The web server is really just a program that\u0026rsquo;s running in your server. There\u0026rsquo;s a technical name for that and they usually call it binding, simple the your web server will be binded to a specific port. There\u0026rsquo;s really a long story for ports and it\u0026rsquo;s quite fascinating, I highly recommend you to read this awesome article about it1.\nSo, now, we are in the server right? Your web server, be it in python or whatever language is listening to the incoming requests. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you sent a request to /login right. We usually json json when we send requests, there are other forms (remember when we used to submit website forms?, Yeah that was one of it). Json is human readable and machine friendly as well, y\u0026rsquo;all can easily read this {\u0026quot;username\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;test\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;password\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;123456\u0026quot;}. That\u0026rsquo;s json. The server now needs to receive the stream of bytes (the request we sent) and parse it. There are so many great stuff happens here, but let\u0026rsquo;s just say that our nice simple python server finally received the bytes, and somehow it was able to read it as json.\nServer does their stuff eg., validation, database calls, etc and responds back with their response, for example it could be a token you use further, or it could be any other thing.\nThe whole thing (request \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; response) happens as a network call between the client (mobile, flutter code, etc) and the server (eg. python web server), through a network layer, via a protocol (http).\nWe call this whole thing api. But to further simplify the process, imagine you are only working on your layer, on your just mobile device, and you want to call a function like \u0026ldquo;login\u0026rdquo;. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that login just verifies you sent {\u0026quot;username\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;mohamed\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;password\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;123456\u0026quot;} \u0026ndash; if you sent this request, it is going to do Navigator.pushNamed(\u0026quot;/settings\u0026quot;), or letting you enter to a widget in your flutter code. That does seem pretty simple, eh? Now imagine the same analogy, but with a very slight difference: the function is not located in our app, and it\u0026rsquo;s only accessible via network call). We can access this function via (https://my.awesome.url/login). We are getting there, right? The same function is accessed via network as oppose of via dart code. The rest is really just semantics.\nI hope that helps.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2021-01-09-what-is-an-api/","summary":"So essentially your mobile is somewhere, with an ip address right?

Beside my own startup, i only worked to Ashrafcom. EEBAx was my first startup that i build with Mohamed Jaafar, https://eebax.com.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to go back to ~ 2013 and how it all started.\nThis website was made by Mohamed Jaafar (the one on the left, obviously 😂), in 2015.\nIn 2014, i had the shortest conversation with Mohamed. I told him i don\u0026rsquo;t think i can fit into Surveying and I want to shift career to software, in a professional way. So in order to do that, we had to build a portfolio, and in order to do that we have to have a domain name (duh!) so we can enlist our projects and show what we are capable off. So, at the end of 2014 school year, we decided to collect some money to make our company. My father secured me my first job at his company, he had me cut my hair as a precondition to get the job! I was Soo into getting the money that I sacrificed my hair. The job was quite simple, I just had to install windows on variety of company devices and install office products too. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take much and by afternoon I finished the job. There was the boss pc and i just couldn\u0026rsquo;t install windows in it, so I told them I\u0026rsquo;m gonna install linux here. They asked me if it runs word AND had Arabic keyboard. I made sure both were there. Now that I remembered it, they had really beautiful IT employee! She\u0026rsquo;s so beautiful I actually couldn\u0026rsquo;t focus on work, I asked her about her work and she said she\u0026rsquo;s a designer and she did various designs and stuff for the company, the weirdest thing is that she asked me whether I have Photoshop and actually told me she didn\u0026rsquo;t have any and asked for courses about it. You\u0026rsquo;d be wondering how a designer don\u0026rsquo;t have photoshop but she\u0026rsquo;s an exception 😂😂\nSo they gave me like 900 or something, now I think it\u0026rsquo;s very small, but back then I felt there is no money beyond it. So I gave my mum and dad couple of hundreds and I saved 400 to myself. I bought a headphone from Amjad Store and we had Fatta at Judy 😂. The Fatta sucked big time, but my excitment with the new headphone helped me to cope with it.\nSo we used the headphone to record our course Learning Matlab From Scratch. The course quicky gained good traction and in no time, we had 5000 subscribers! That was waaay too much! Jaafar on the other hand applied for a freelancing job at UpWork. He landed a 270$ job through a logo! It was Soo so great. We bought eebax.com, and paid for a few internet expenses too!\nOne thing I just remembered is the name Eebax. So, Mohamed told me to think about a name, and honestly I thought the name he would come up with would be better than mine, I was thinking about XEng but I never told him about it. So, a few days later he asked me again and I told him I still didn\u0026rsquo;t have any. So um while we\u0026rsquo;re heading back to the dorm, I asked him about his exs name. He told me her name was Eeba (she\u0026rsquo;s Pakistani). So I told him we should name it Eeba. He said his family / friends would notice, so we added the suffix X as a salt to make it not that clear:joy:. He was not really convinced about the idea, but he went onboard about it soob Oh god!

You can also employ local firewall policies in your server (using ufw or iptables), but they are usually not that effective. This is a datacenter compliance problem! If your datacenter provider doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a firewall, then they violated PCI DSS #1 rule and you should change your datacenter. That simple!\nChange all default password on network connected devices\nDevil lies in the details. While this seemingly easy task to do, EBS security dedicates a huge pile of todos and what not regarding this simple one.\nWhat does this simply means is to change your default password for your server (that was assigned by the cloud provider). It goes further to basically change any vendor assigned password since these can be known to hackers.\nProtect stored card holder data Hmm. Interesting. What if you don\u0026rsquo;t even store them?\nOn the sending end, we do use TLS to encrypt our transactions between our servers (btw did you know ACTUALLY EBS USES SELF SIGNED CERT AND CLIENTS, LIKE US, HAVE TO SKIP TLS VERIFICATION WHEN CONNECTING TO EBS. Now you know.)\nStoring card holder data is tricky. We partially do it, albiet recommend against it very clearly in the app.\nEncrypt card holder data in transit Yeah, see above\nInstall malware protection WTF. WE use Linux. Maybe it makes sense if this rule were rewrote to something like this:\nEnsure that your backend services are run with a non-root user (e.g, if you are using docker it is more secure to run docker in a non root mode, by creating a new user and user group for docker. This way you gonna isolate your program and backend service from the rest of the system) Patch vulnerabilities This is really important and totally overlooked. In a retrospect, it goes against EBS certifcation process.\nLet us discuss what vulnerabilities are:\nwe have vulnerabilities in our OS we have vulnerabilities in our installed packages in our OS we have vulnerabilities in our programming langauge we have vulnerabilities in our libraries and frameworks we use in our programming language _This rule simply means, you have to regulary update your OS, update your OS packages, update your programming language version, and update your programming langauge libraries and frameworks (the one you use to write your hopefully PCI compliant system). But that also goes further to the client of this backend system, now here the shit gets real.\nWorking with clients or in this case POS devices and mobile apps is tricky. It gets extra tricky when working with POS devices, and devil\u0026rsquo;s level of tricky-ness when working with Linux-based POS devices.\nMajority of POS devices are using SSL. The good ones use TLS v1.1 which is permittable albeit not recommended. The recommended version is TLS v1.2 (which in itsefl is deprecated1). This is a huge problem since TLS or SSL v3 have really severe security impacts. The other annoying thing is that they actually affect the whole backend system security level as we have to support these devices!\nThe situation is like this (in our server):\nTLS v1.1, TLS v1.2, TLS v1.3 (WTF!) EBS:\nTLS v1.2 TLS v1.1 TLS v1.0 (FUCK)\nIt makes sense though, since EBS must have to support wide range of obsolete and insecure POS devices. Let\u0026rsquo;s just not ever again discuss EBS wound. It hurts.\nRestrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel You don\u0026rsquo;t need to restrict access to card holder data if you are not storing any of them. But in all cases, it makes sense to write this and consider it in the company\u0026rsquo;s process document.\nControl and restrict system access You bet.\nControl and restrict physical access to cardholder data Sure.\nMonitor access to data This is hard and it requires thinking (which way more harder actually, thinking sometimes lead to sinking). But practically speaking, a combination of rsyslog and sshd and /var/log/auth.log can help with that. Essentially what you want to achieve is that whenever someone attempts to access your server, you get notified via email. That\u0026rsquo;s monitoring. You can go all fancy and make a dashboard for that too.\nTest security systems regularly And this is where systems in Sudan fall short. No testing whatsoever have been done after the certification is issued and that is quite catastrophic. Can you imaging swiping your card in a system that has not been maintained for over couple of years (and even more!)\nMaintain an information security policy This falls in good suggestions yet no one cares! But it is important it is extremely important to maintain security policy and adhere to it. It should be part of the company process and manual.

We should pass the memory address to user log.Printf(\u0026#34;The user is: %s\u0026#34;, u.Name) // New Name But in go, we slightly use a different syntax for this, we use a method receiver on the struct. More like method to classes on other languages.\nThe code will be something like this.\ntype User struct { Name string } func (u User) changeMe(u User) { u.Name = \u0026#34;New Name\u0026#34; } func main(){ u := User{Name: \u0026#34;mohamed\u0026#34;} changeMe(u) log.Printf(\u0026#34;The user is: %s\u0026#34;, u.Name) // mohamed } Note that, we are still printing in mohamed, as we are still passing to the changeMe method a new value. We pass by value in Go. To pass by reference (as in Python or Java), we do this slight change:\ntype User struct { Name string } func (u *User) changeMe(u User) { u.Name = \u0026#34;New Name\u0026#34; } func main(){ u := User{Name: \u0026#34;mohamed\u0026#34;} changeMe(\u0026amp;u) log.Printf(\u0026#34;The user is: %s\u0026#34;, u.Name) // New Name } This very small but subtle change was a cause of horror for me in the past couple of days.\nabout marshalling Or really how to do http handlers wrong!\nIn go, everything is initialized to its zero value: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; for a string, 0 for int, and nil for pointers. That turns out to be very powerful and it indeeds avoid certain types of bugs. It is also very convenient to use as well. One bad pitfalls of it, but not relevant to my bug is how to differentiate between zero as a value or zero as a initial value. We usually make these types pointers to get a nil instead of its zero value \u0026ndash; especially when a zero value is actually meaningful. For example, EBS response code for successfull transactions is 0, and at the same time, when our connection to EBS times out (or any other http connection errors), we get a zero as well (since it is initialized to its zero value). Subtle, but helpful.\nNow, how does that work if we were the server and not the client. That turns out to be very interesting in two distinctive places:\nGo\u0026rsquo;s encoding/json library and global state (yeah global is really really terrible) Let us get back to our previous example again and add some json marshalling to it. For breifty our code was like this, i also added an http handler\ntype User struct { ID int // add this field just to make sense Name string } func (u *User) changeMe(u User) { u.Name = \u0026#34;New Name\u0026#34; } func main(){ u := User{Name: \u0026#34;mohamed\u0026#34;} changeMe(\u0026amp;u) log.Printf(\u0026#34;The user is: %s\u0026#34;, u.Name) http.HandlerFunc(\u0026#34;/create\u0026#34;, createNewUser) http.ListenAndServe(\u0026#34;:8080\u0026#34;, nil) // New Name } // the correct approach func createNewUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){ var u User body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body) // handle err defer r.Body.Close() // we have []byte body, let\u0026#39;s marshall it err := json.Marshall(body, \u0026amp;u) // since json.Marshall accepts an interface, we have to send to it the pointer of u not its value // do DB writeup, etc.. } Now, if we curl:\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/create -d '{\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Mohamed\u0026quot;}'\nNow, this is cool, simple and straightforward. This code works well. Now let\u0026rsquo;s fuck it up a bit. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna make a few changes to instate this brain fuckery.\ntype User struct { ID int // add this field just to make sense Name string } func (u *User) changeMe(u User) { u.Name = \u0026#34;New Name\u0026#34; } var u \u0026amp;User func init(){ u.DB = getMyDbHandler() } func main(){ http.HandlerFunc(\u0026#34;/create\u0026#34;, u.createNewUser) http.ListenAndServe(\u0026#34;:8080\u0026#34;, nil) // This is bad code... VERY BAD TERRIBLE ONE } // the correct approach func (u *User)createNewUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){ body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body) // handle err defer r.Body.Close() // we have []byte body, let\u0026#39;s marshall it err := json.Marshall(body, u) // since json.Marshall accepts an interface, we have to send to it the pointer of u not its value // do DB writeup, etc.. } What we did is actually simply following one of Go\u0026rsquo;s http handlers practices. We want to share the DB connection among our services as oppose of creating a new db instead EVERYTIME we connect to a database.\nThis code has two subtilities:\nit manages a global state that is shared between the program (var u \u0026amp;User) When we json.Marshall in createNewUser, we are not marshalling to a new zero-initialized User struct. Instead we are overriding a previous User struct (e.g., made from a previous request). And this is a stright up memory fuckery.\nThis is literally like this:\n- user1 sends a request and it compelted - when user2 sends a request it overrides user1's *data* Now, when the really shit gets going:\nand it also subjects to an error in json marshalling Let\u0026rsquo;s see\nhow does json marshalling works in Go json.Marshall takes an interface and the reason for that is:\nin go we don\u0026rsquo;t have generics type json.Marshall uses reflect (or reflection) to get the underlying type of the interface pointer and what we refer to in go as struct tags. They are special syntax attached to the struct to be used by json.Marshall to achieve certain features, one of them being json representation for a struct field, etc. For example, if we were to return {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Mohamed\u0026quot;}, instead of {\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Mohamed\u0026quot;}, we were to do this in User struct definition:\ntype User struct { Name string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` } and so on.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s walk through how json.Marshall actually works in Go:\nAnd bear in mind that every value in go is initalized to its zero value.\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SEND IN NULL, FROM THE CLIENT!\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/create -d '{\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: null, \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;: 1}'\nNow this is interesting!\nWell, that depends. State is bad my friend. Don\u0026rsquo;t ever manage a state.\nWhen we first launch the program $ print(u) {Name: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, ID: 1} Now, let\u0026rsquo;s curl it again, but this time with a value for Name\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/create -d '{\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;mohamed\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;: 1}'\n$ print(u) {Name: \u0026#34;mohamed\u0026#34;, ID: 1} NOW, let\u0026rsquo;s curl it again, but this time with null instead. I also changed the ID so one can see where i\u0026rsquo;m going with this!\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/create -d '{\u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: null, \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;: 10}'\n$ print(u) {Name: \u0026#34;mohamed\u0026#34;, ID: 10} WTF! WTF!!!! how this even happened!\nThe reason is two things:\nin our struct tag, we defined Name as a string, not NULL! and the major fuckery is that our code manages state. So, it has the previous data stored there. The previous request data stored there! In languages like python and javascript, where memory model is so abstracted away it is so hard to fall into this kind of bugs. But in go you do and you do that very simply.\nWhen marshalling a value, in reflection encoding/json iterate through all exported fields to get and match their types with the incoming json. If it fails, it leaves in the specific field as it is with its value and not attempt to change it. That is usefull, totally intuitive and makes sense and a source of a bug for our program.\nThe simple fix is to refactor the struct code to be something like this:\ntype UserService struct { User ... add other fields here } And change the /create handler to be a method receiver for UserService not for User. The reason being we want to preserve state in UserService (for example we want to store DB connection there), AND not storing or keeping track of the User.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2020-10-30-values-types-and-pointers/","summary":"This post highlights a weird and expected behavior we encountered while using Go\u0026rsquo;s encoding/json library.\nIn go, we pass by value, that really means this:\ntype User struct { Name string } func changeMe(u User) { u.Name = \u0026#34;New Name\u0026#34; } func main(){ u := User{Name: \u0026#34;mohamed\u0026#34;} changeMe(u) log.Printf(\u0026#34;The user is: %s\u0026#34;, u.Name) // mohamed } To change by value, we must pass a pointer, we can change the code to be something like this:","title":"Values and pointers: What could possibly go wrong?"},{"content":"I have not written any post recently (4 months since my breakup post).

That actually makes sense as software can be done remotely and for that we have really built awesome infrastrucutre supporting this: from email, to Slack and Zoom. Everything we do in software is inherently remote-friendly.\n9 - 5 Work has become a lifestyle and a fundamental part of our daily routine. 9 - 5 is extremely arbitrary; it has nothing to do with peak performance time nor backed by any efficiency measure. It is no surprise that peak performance times varies from someone to other. But, regardless, we have be somewhere between 9 - 5; it would be weird to stay at home at such.\nBut again, what work really is?\nWhat if i don\u0026rsquo;t want to work.\nYou need to work, because:\nyou need to pay your bills and the necessary expenses you have to build a career your career can support you when you finally retire There is a theme there. All of these listed items are basic human needs. You are not asking anything more than food and a place to live under!\nSo why bother, why should i work?\nUniversal Basic Income From wikipedia:\nBasic income, also called universal basic income (UBI), citizen\u0026rsquo;s income, citizen\u0026rsquo;s basic income, basic income guarantee, basic living stipend, guaranteed annual income, or universal demogrant, is a theoretical governmental public program for a periodic payment delivered to all citizens of a given population without a means test or work requirement.1\nfor real Universal basic income seems to be too good to be true. It is really a big investment to endeavor and lots of countries like Sudan might not be able to actually to implement it. For example, we don\u0026rsquo;t have sufficient cash to secure our energy needs. Being also a state-based inititative, that also puts us into the usual socialism trap: states are run by business man and multi-national corporates, it is just too hard to fight them all. However the theory sounds, when you cannot implement it when you cannot materialize it, it becomes just a \u0026ldquo;good theory\u0026rdquo; and that really sucks.\nThere are other types of share-based companies that can help with that and it proven to be successfull like Co-Ops and cooperation movement in general 2. Co-Ops gives nice incentives for employees since they are all shareholders; one down side is that not all employees are equal and not all efforts are the same. That makes it work extremely well in places where labors have ~ equally the same responsibilites (e.g., agro coops, and in Sudan Arabic Gum Coops and other similar coops). It is important to note that intensive labor ideas really works well back then when a labor is giving it all to the business owner. I can hardly imagine the same scenario being in software business.\nShargii: how we do our business In Shargii, we really have this undefined work. The bottom line is we cannot afford to pay our employees their salaries, so what we do instead is giving them revenue share. Revenue share is particularly useful in that it is fair for employees and also beneficial to the company.\nRevenue share has its own problems as well. Not everyone can actually be able to wait until a product is monetized. And this might not be their responsibilities too.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2020-09-04-work/","summary":"I have not written any post recently (4 months since my breakup post).

The effort it takes to build a successful startup is far more great than \u0026ldquo;just being an employee\u0026rdquo;. Startups are not actually for everyone, and that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them any better than well established companies.\nentrepreneurship the hidden side I have read so many articles and posts everywhere about startups. Missioniries of startups. And it is getting quite wild recently. There\u0026rsquo;s actually startups for startups. But, i\u0026rsquo;m not here to talk about startups at all. My concern is those people who are building these startups. The entrepreneurs.\nA little bit about me, I worked on G\u0026amp;I, and then later Solus, before that I built EEBAx (https://wadjaafar.github.io), in 2014. So i think i know a bit about entrepreneurships. (in between, I taught at UofK and worked at Ashrafcom.)\ndon\u0026rsquo;t do it Whenever i read any post on enterpneurship i scream inside don\u0026rsquo;t do it, idiot. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing inherently bad about employment at all! If you do have a fulltime job, don\u0026rsquo;t quit it! If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a fulltime job, you won\u0026rsquo;t succeed in your entrepreneurship endeavor at all!\nIf you really want to do it, then\ndo the homework Why do you want to be an entrepreneur? I mean, there is no such title as entrepreneur, like what will be your real job description as an entrepreneur?\nIf it is management, then you really ought to learn more about management. Managing people is the hardest thing at all If it is software, maybe you can better off work as a consultant, freelancer, etc. Just being a good software developer doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should be an entrepreneur. There\u0026rsquo;s no problem of just being technical savy If you have a huge capital, why not just investing on other startups. I see many people instead of investing on a well established startups, they would rather make a new business. the same greatly applies for business and marketing too notes i work at Solus, it happens to be my startup too. And it has been very tough, every time. Unlike, employment you have to take care about everything. Rents, salaries, bills, utility, internet and social deviation. I have not had any vacation in 4 years. The struggle is everywhere. I live in my office, the work is literally 24/7. Your job becomes your life and it is just so terrible. If you are reading this notes, consider entrepreneurship again.\nThe odds you become the next facebook is ZERO, if you are doing this to impress people, and monetize your suffering and (your fellow entrepreneurs as well), you are a psychopath. Don\u0026rsquo;t sell people (and yourself first) false imaginations. You are hallucinating. It is just disgustingly ugly.\nBut startups are really a nice place to work. They disrupt things! I hate stable situations, it is quite boring whenever thing went as smooth.\nto live is to risk it all.

The cash will be in the form of Airtime, the minutes of calls that telecos charge. Telecos have a very large agents network in Sudan and it has grown to extent that they reach remote locations even electricity have not reached it! The standard airtime cash out fees is around 10% but it has grown to 20% during the cash crisis last year. There is no regulation for airtime cash out fees, as oppose of standard ATM withdraw (1 SDG), and as a result it gained huge interest for agents. Until couple of years ago, there was no regulation for the maximum allowed airtime transactions, but it was limited to 1000 SDG (and 100 SDG during the cash crisis). Currently, it was reverted back to 1000 SDG.\nAirtime is money The government proposed a simple subsidy model: give money to poor people in terms of airtime. Let\u0026rsquo;s calculate that and see what these numbers mean:\nThe target is 900,000 Family (around 4.5 M person), the selection criteria is still not disclosed though The amount is 1500 Airtime SDG The USD rate (Central Bank of Sudan) is 45.1125 SDG 4 The USD rate (black market) is 94 SDG 5 Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how that work in real life:\nthe Sudaneses government will debit 1500 SDG every year telecos will issue an equivalent of 1500 as airtime to the target audience users\u0026rsquo; then can go to a local agent and cash out their airtime Calculations Let\u0026rsquo;s calculate the airtime fees and see how these numbers add up.\n1500 Airtime * 10% (cash out fees): 1350 SDG\nFor 900,000 we have for 1 year:\n1500 * 900000 * 12 = 16,200,000,000 SDG Actual price when cash out = 1,620,000,000 SDG But telecos impose extra fees as well for government. Telecos are service provider for the government. It could be as well 2%, and it could be even more. That is 324,000,000 SDG / year.\nTotal calculations\nAmount Per Interval AIRTIME Amount Per Interval SDG Agents Fees Telecos Fees from government [SDG] Total Amount One Family 1 Month 1500 1350 150 30 1530 900K Family (all target) 1 Month 1,350,000,000 1,215,000,000 135,000,000‬ 27,000,000‬ 1,377,000,000 900K Family (all target) 12 Month 16,200,000,000 14,580,000,000 A tale of telecs Telecos airtime agent is distributed in a network. The logic is quite simple, in order to sustain their business. Airtime is distributed on three channels:\nscratchable cards POS-based airtime credits and recently airtime through payment network i.e., EBS, 6 The bulk of airtime is divided into these channels, through telecos airtime master agents.\nAirtime master agents They are the agents which a teleco distribute its airtime. It is a very tight club that the whole airtime is exclusively distributed through them.\nIf the said teleco is to issue 1,000,000 of airtime value monthly, it goes like this:\nit will be distributed to telecos master agents telecos master agents have specific geographical locations that they operate on (and the don\u0026rsquo;t collide) agents then have their own other agents i.e., master agents on state level (agent 1 for White Nile State) and the chain goes on until it reaches the smallest agent. The one that airtime cash out / airtime cash in happens This is perhaps the most complex network, and yet totally unregulated. It is a huge monoply, and it is only governed by the telecos. The rules are simple: don\u0026rsquo;t release too many airtime that it loses it value, and avoid shortage in airtime! Telecos are optimizing for these two constraints.\nWhat telecos make I tried\nYou can use this as the economist article is behind a payroll https://pioneer4peace.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/airtime-is-money/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/01/19/airtime-is-money\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttp://www.mof.gov.sd/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9/item/683-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%86\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.price-today.com/currency-prices-sudan/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.price-today.com/currency-prices-sudan/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nEven for EBS/CBOS case, they pay in advance.

When working with Cashqbot our Telegram Payment Bot. We have /rate feature which allows our users to get the USD rate of today Thanks to the folks of price today. I will just go through how we implmeneted this feature and what we can learn from that.\nmake it works for GOD\u0026rsquo;S sake! it is of zero use to discuss about any fancy api design when the functionality is not working!\nThis part is quite easy, we used of go x/html stuff to parse www.price-today.com/currency-prices-sudan. Parsing was quite straightforward:\nwe iterate through html tag that contains our fields match against our hardcoded values (representing the fields we want) final round of clearing the text and parsing the strings to floats Now, it actually works, whenever we call this function we get a result. And it is mostly the same result, every time.\nWe shipped the code as it is.\nit works, let\u0026rsquo;s enhance it This system has a problem, everytime a user\u0026rsquo;s hit /rate we make an external http call to the currency website. And we parse it too. The external http call is quite expensive, and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to bloat our good folks with unnecessary traffic. Cache it.\nThe idea is we want an in-memory caching that allows us to store and retrieve data. It should also invlidates the cache. We found a third part go library that offers a nice caching api.\nOur caching stopped working! TESTING TESTING TESTING\nLet\u0026rsquo;s enlist the dependancies to see where things could possibly go wrong:\nwe are relying on an external caching library we are relying on an external provider (for currency rate) we have also refactored the code to make the rate service an external grpc endpoint. Things are getting pretty tough now.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t optimize twice There\u0026rsquo;s no rule for this and it seems quite arbitrary actually. In procedural linear systems catching bugs is really simple! You just traverse through the program until you hit that line that breaks and then you fix it.\nWhen hitting /rate, this happens:\nwe query the cache service to see if we have any valid values, if yes we use this value and we are all set ready 🚀. if not, we: call the rate function retrieve the value and update the cache get the value from the cache Since rate service will be used by different clients on our stack, we find that it makes sense to refactor it and make it a grpc endpoint, so now we have:\nwe query the cache service to see if we have any valid values, if yes we use this value and we are all set ready 🚀. if not, we: call the rate grpc endpoint retrieve the value and update the cache get the value from the cache You can see that we copy-pasted the previous listing.\nNow, we can use our rate service from different platforms without rewriting it over and over.\nBut none of that fixed the problem.\ntesting is vital for software Software is intrinsically broken, and the moment you realize that you stop trusting everything, and most importantly YOU!\nOur external currency provider has changed their html which break all of our parsing logic. We fixed it.\nrevisiting the design The rate service was a good decision. It will allow for this service to grow independantly from the rest of the system, while being used by different clients. In cashqbot, it was like 100 LOC, but what if we want to add more currency providers? What if we want to handle different currencies than just USD (this will likely result in breaking current implementation). It can also decide to maintain the api for these clients, while having another one. The possibilities are endless. It can grow too much that containing it in cashqbot requirements. And software always grows. Containment is wrong. Embrace its complexity and let it grows without affecting other parts. Let it grow independently.\nlibrary and the clients Libraries are made to handle the general case, their clients should accounts for the special cases. The design of rate service is quite simple:\nit uses grpc protocol it gets the result with error if available It is the responsibility of the client to implement the protocol and to handle the errors. But, what about caching the results? It is the client responsibility to handle the results. rate service doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about this, it just gets a (float32, error). Adding the cache there is completely hurtful \u0026ndash; and I see lot\u0026rsquo;s of people do that. The clients are responsible for implementing this logic. And this is the gist of this post.\nrate limiting cashqbot has a go routine that handles the limiting service, the logic is quite simple:\nget the result and store it in a package level variable a ticker channel that activates every [TIME] at each time it activates, we update that variable by connection to rate service our bot rate handler becomes like this: // it is not exactly this way, but it is the gist of it func rate() float32{ return myGlobalRateVariable } Results We have refactored the rate function into a new rate service that is exposed over grpc endpoint. The new grpc service can grow in complexity while not affecting other system components and maintinaing backward compatibility We have hugely simplified bot rate handler The rate service is not tightly coupled to any client\u0026rsquo;s specifications We hardened our tests for the rate service parsing logic ","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2020-01-15-refactoring-and-debugging/","summary":"This post is about how to design libraries.

You hear the term PCI a lot.\nThe standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud. ~ Wikipedia\nWe (financial institutions) offer our clients (card holders) these services to ease their access into their accounts. In most cases, the bank takes the liability for any frauds that happen. So, PCI standards are used in the whole payment process, in the card, POS, and the payment network itself, EBS. It is the industry best practices for the security.\nWhat could possibly go wrong, 1 Again, we have four parties in the payment process\nthe card holder (issuer) the merchant, POS the payment network and the bank (acquirer) We need to secure the transaction in every one of them. All of the credit cards in Sudan are magnetic strip ones. There are, indeed, EMV ones, but our systems don\u0026rsquo;t support EMV transactions. Magnetic strip cards are very cheap as oppose of their counterpart, EMV ones. And there in lies a problem.\nWhat defines your card is actually just three fields: PAN, PIN, expDate (I intentionally used their EBS request fields one). I can encode your PAN and expDate into a newly printed card and use it as if it were your card! (I will have to guess your PIN, which will be your birth year.) These are not new problems, it is known for years and people have moved into new security practices, EMV.

This way, even someone has hacked the system, they will only gets to see this random string that does nothing! Unlike magnetic strip ones, your data won\u0026rsquo;t be sent over the wire\u0026ndash;just a very secure random text will be.\n{\u0026#34;EMV\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;very secure text\u0026#34;} Even if the system was hacked, I cannot use these information to retrieve any of the cards data. But, we cannot just simply upgrade to EMV. It requires a whole infrastructure upgrade. And that\u0026rsquo;s pretty expensive. VERY expensive. And we don\u0026rsquo;t need it, either.\nWe know the current system issues, you can either wait for someone to fix them, or know these issues and work with them. ~ Omrabi\nI totally agree with this view. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we need to upgrade the system and I don\u0026rsquo;t think that upgrading it will solve any of the current problems.\nTowards EMV system Upgrading our infrastructure is challenging. We need to upgrade the whole infrastructure\nEMV cards Certified EMV POS and a payment network that accepts EMV transactions We have EMV POS, in fact, most of our POS in Morsal are EMV ones. But the challenging part is upgrading all of these POS to use EMV info instead of magnetic strip ones. This won\u0026rsquo;t be possible at all and it will hurt the system. The card part, while being the easiest, is also challenging. Magnetic strip cards are really cheap. You can get one by as low as cents. While EMV ones are very expensive. Given that there is no demand on even the cheap ones, why would you force people into investing one something that is not used?\nWhat about the payment network?\nWhy not just ditching the whole merchant thingy? EBS has introduced new APIs called Consumer. They are used as a way to enable transactions over internet. From PCI PIN securtiy requirements #1\nAll cardholders-entered PINs must be processed in equipment that conforms to the requirements for secure cryptographic devices (SCDs). PINs must never appear in the clear outside of an SCD.\nTranslation: you cannot just enter your PIN over a merchants keyboard. The keyboard you\u0026rsquo;re keyying your PIN in must hash your PIN to avoid keylogging. This is why you don\u0026rsquo;t see merchants with PCs. But people love to use their credit card over the internet right?\nEBS has introduced new set of APIs called consumer APIs. As their names imply, they are used by consumers, and they are mainly used to allow ecommerce. To solve the problem of PIN should be entered over SCD they use something called IPIN, or internet PIN. But that affects the whole system, in a very disastoruos way.\nPCI standards PCI standards are established to secure the transactions and to decrease the fraud cases. A payment system should be PCI complaint at every endpoint of it. It is the only possible way to integrate with other payment systems.\nUsing Consumer and IPIN allowed us to make PCI compliant transactions over internet, but that comes with a huge cost. Every other bank with private switch (e.g., Khartoum Bank) cannot use this functionality. They don\u0026rsquo;t have an IPIN. Let\u0026rsquo;s revise the payment process again. You have an internet store where you sell books, you allow your customers to pay for the book\u0026rsquo;s price online. And you\u0026rsquo;re connected to EBS. EBS uses iPIN instead of PIN, right? Very soon you will notice that your Bank of Khartoum clients cannot use your service. accepts iPIN | issuer =\u0026gt; payment_network =\u0026gt; acquirer | accepts PIN != wrong pin entered BoK\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no such a thing as iPIN in BoK switch. While you can happily use your BoK card in every possible merchant (POS), you cannot do the same over internet. The just don\u0026rsquo;t match. So, for our system to be a PCI compliant, we introduced new APIs that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with the country\u0026rsquo;s major Bank. Good job guys, you nailed it there.\nRequirement 2a: Cardholder PINs shall be processed in accordance with approved standards. a. All cardholder PINs processed online must be encrypted and decrypted using an approved cryptographic technique that provides a level of security compliant with international and industry standards. Any cryptographic technique implemented meets or exceeds the cryptographic strength of TDEA using double-length keys. b. All cardholder PINs processed offline using IC card technology must be protected in accordance with the requirements in Book 2 of the EMV IC Card Specifications for Payment Systems and ISO 9654.\nEBS v2.0 Make it PCI complaint Ditch the consumer to interoperate with other switches Ditch the merchant layer, to be a PCI complaint You cannot fix the unfixable, mate. ~ Captain Jack Sparrow\nThe current system cannot be PCI complaint. It requires rewriting and renewing the whole infrastructure, EBS itself, every POS, all of the cards. This is not possible. Merchant layer abuses PCI at every possible way, yet it is the only working one. You cannot ditch it either. And none of these issues actually have affected the system adoption. Let\u0026rsquo;s first make the transformation, and later think of improving or replacing what we have.\nnoebs When I launched this project one of my goals is to fix exactly these kinda of issues. The name might not be the greatest, but if anything, If anything, we are embracing the use of EBS. One of the first design decisions I took was to use EBS merchant services and totally ignore consumer ones. And that turns out to be very good decision. Here\u0026rsquo;s our solution to the aroused problems.\nthere will be one and only one service: merchant. It will allow interoperability between all switches. to secure the PIN over internet issue, we will be using an OTP that will be sent over the cardholder mobile number. Our philosophy is to do what others do. And they are all using OTP to validate the transaction was initiated from the original card holder, not of a security breach. Of course that is not the most secure system either, but you always have to take the risk. If you compare it, you will find that it is more risky to use magnetic strip cards than to enter your PIN over internet. They are really the same. There is no single POS that employs SCD practices anyway. We designed a new API layer, with a new security check called IPIN to comply with PCI PIN requirements. It affects the whole system. Our system is not PCI complaint, at almost every piece of it. STOP PCI BULLYING and be dynamic for the good of the community. This problem cannot be solved unless the whole parties come together and discuss them. We encourage openess, interoperability and building systems that comply with the industry standards. We also beleive that, for the good of the system, we can skip these standards and encourage the system adoption with its whole problems.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2018-11-19-how-to-design-bad-systems/","summary":"This post is about systems, APIs, business decisions.\nPayment Nearly every transaction involves three parties: a merchant that accepts the card, a bank that issues it, and a payment network that facilitates the transaction between the first two parties.

I\u0026rsquo;ve TAed different classes\u0026ndash;mostyl computational/programming ones. It was very nice experience, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more happier. Though, I have some notes.\nNational Service The national service is the single most evil, human rights violation thing has ever been done. Our governers are literally using us to cover for their economical failures. The national service is a one year that each graduate student should serve in military. Usually, people prefer to do their national service in non-military places. That was exploited pretty well bad by the government sector. In my case, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t physically fitted to do my national service in a miliant facility. Luckily, I met all the requirements to be accepted at UofK.\nSome notes In my first semester, I have TAed Phyiscal Geodesy, 5th year students; Adjustment Computations, 4th year. I\u0026rsquo;m do not intend to write a detailed post about each class, I might do that later.\nI think that physical geodesy is the toughest class ever. Students find huge difficulty in understanding the class materials. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to ease the course by adding more programming exercises. E.g., the class project was about building a program to compute the geoid.\nMost of students suffer much in mathematical intensive classes. I suspect that might be because the way courses are offered: You don\u0026rsquo;t get to choose what courses you want to take.\nMany of mathematical classes are poorly taught. They are not oriented towards engineering. Compared these courses to any of MIT\u0026rsquo;s for instance. In our particular case, geodesy heavily relies on physics, calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. Well, on papers, all four year students have already taken these courses. The problem is, in my opinion, in the way that courses been taught. I still remember my linear algebra tutorials. We were so into proves. I have had solved many of Schaum\u0026rsquo;s problems. However, these skills were totally irrelevant to my field of study. The same applied to statistics and probabilities. Did you know that, college statistics are still taught with the same \u0026ldquo;what is the mean? There are four oranage balls and five red balls in a basket, what is the probability of grabbing a red ball\u0026rdquo;. That is not helping at all.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t agree to the 70 final exam and 30 class work policy. It is very ridiclous. It encourages students to only study for the final exam. I have seen that, I\u0026rsquo;ve done it, too.\nLack of communication between students and their instructor. Well, this might not be the biggest problem, but it is still there.\nMany students do not know how to use email.\nStudents cheat all the time. You may not believe that, but I well known Imam (Sheikh), have given a fatwa that\nCopying answers from your friends is not Haram.\nWell, while others don\u0026rsquo;t need that fatwa anyway, but I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to help you understand how our problems are fundamental. Just to be clear, that Imam\u0026rsquo;s fatwa was about cheating in tutorials and homeworks not in exams. Cheating in exams happens occurs also at a scary level. Every year, a few students got caught and suspended for an year or two because of cheating cases. Many other cases occured but they were ignored. I will get to cheating point later.\nThere are plenty of others, I might add as we go, or discuss them in the forum.\nThings we have tried to do Here are a few things I have tried to do. Just to be clear, they are used in other institutions, so I have no credit for any of them.\nPiazza is an online forum for courses discussions and announcements. It helps students to get in touch with the course instructors, and also help the course instructors to know how their students are doing in the course. The good thing is, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to make any posters on the department\u0026rsquo;s walls, or call some student to tell the others that there will be a test on Wednesday, and some students tell you that they hadn\u0026rsquo;t been told. It was solved! The unfortunate bad thing is, some students find it too difficult to register, or use the website. Though, I clearly remember I have given them a fast ten minutes on how to use Piazza.\nI believe that assignmets are the best way for students to understand any computational class materials. So, instead of giving them a 30-minutes to solve a toy problem and then collect their works, I made them assignments that needs more then just a few minutes to solve. Some professors didn\u0026rsquo;t agree with this idea. They urged that we\u0026rsquo;re just giving the students extra days to cheat from each others. Cheating happens, a lot. There is no clear policy on how to deal with cheating cases in e.g., tests, mid-terms, or in assignments.\nPapers are hard to deal with. I urge that they don\u0026rsquo;t contribute too much to student\u0026rsquo;s writing skills. They might be used in the first year, but I totally don\u0026rsquo;t get why they are still used in senior years. I have tried to avoid hardcopy assignments as much as I can. Students were not allowed to submit their assignments in hardcopy format at all. (Except for the very very rare situations.) PDF rocks!\nStudents were asked to write their assignments using LaTeX. LaTeX is really nice in that the user doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about the styling. While the students had had terrible nights dealing with LaTeX, the reward was very huge in their theses.\nGrading is the most horrible thing to do. It takes a lot of time and effort. One might biased. We used gradescope to handle students\u0026rsquo; submissions and release assignments. Well, it works very well for me, however, it was a nightmare for some students. One told me that he had had spent four days trying to submit his assignment. Gradescope definitely is not that difficult. Again, students really lack many things. One nice thing I liked about gradescope is autograding for programming assignments. While I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to setup one for the course (I had to build a docker version for the programming language, etc. Docker was blocked for the Sudan, and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had a great internet connection to do the VPN+other docker build steps.) Autograder will definitely save you a lot of hours, and it\u0026rsquo;s biased-free, too.\nGradescope was also great in controlling the assignments submissions. You can specify the release day, and the due. It will magically close after the due. Students can also submit a regrade request through gradescope (they were seeing their grades for each submission). We hadn\u0026rsquo;t use that, anyone needed to regrade. One thing I noticed about the release, due thing is: many students submit only on the last day. Even though they already completed the assignment. I had to tell them that they can submit at any time between the release date and the final date!\nThe grades for each assignment and other course works were all published to the students, and they were encouraged to ask for any revision. That really helped me to make things transparent between me and the students. It is your right to know exactly your marks. We are human, we make mistakes all the time.\nIn all the tutorials I have not taken any attendance. I still cannot get this idea. I mean, if someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to attend, why are we forcing them inti doing that? That definitely will not help them understand the materials. Is not this the goal of what we are doing? I was worried that no one would attend, however, that just didn\u0026rsquo;t happen! I think that students are mature enough to decide whether they want to attend this lecture or not. Attending lectures/tutorials should not be the way how we assess them. Maybe they were bored, or tired, or on a bad mood, or even they are just- God help me -don\u0026rsquo;t need to attend at all! Don\u0026rsquo;t you think that taking attendance is time consuming?\nNotes for students Hey there! How are you doing? Here is the thing. I once said that, your time is more precious than ours (as instructors), and that we are doing everything for you. I still believe in that. College is an invesment for you. It is five years of your life\u0026ndash;not to mention the tuition and living fees. Try to learn as much as you can. Try to connect with people inside your institution and people from outside. Be active in Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Week and other activities. These are the things that will shape your life.\nYour professors and TAs are not evil (sick) persons. Why not go to and ask them about relevant problems to their field, or career questions, etc. They have such a great experience, they will definitely help you.\nWhen I was a student, we haven\u0026rsquo;t had too much of connections with both professors and lecturers. It might be a problem related to us (or me). As a TA, I have tried to connect to as much students as I could. I did that because it is healthy for the learning process.\nNotes for my fellow TAs Hi dudes! How is it going?\nI know you are not doing fine at all. You are working in a full time position, and having a generous salary of 150 sdg (7.5 USD)! Things couldn\u0026rsquo;t be any better! I totally feel your pain. TAs are the most crucial part in undergrad studies. You have to do the tutorials, the grading, and then sometimes midterms, and the exams, etc. You are doing everything. And, you are totally not appreciated. For me, and probably for most of you, I had to depend on my family for living. 150sdg is just shameful. It would be more appropriate if were paid something that covers our living expenses. Just living expenses. At some part you just be like why the fuck am I doing this? Cannot I just drop my work and start working in other place? Teaching is really tough. TAs responsibilities are way too much. Having known all of that, students have nothing to do with this: we have to work very hard to give them proper materials.\nNotes for the administration guys I need to be more formal here.\nI wrote this post as a summary of my work at University of Khartoum. These notes were never meant to hurt, attack anyone. I wish that you consider discussing these issues I presented and think of ways to address them. I wish that these notes highlight some of the problems we face at UofK.\n","permalink":"https://adonese.sd/post/2017-10-28-a-year-at-uofk/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always been dreaming of teaching.\nI worked as a teaching assistant at University of Khartoum, Geomatics Engineering department.

We are also creating Geodesy Study group. We have many reasons as to why this study group is important. We need people to understand geodesy and thereafter apply it.\nAfter three months, I will write another post describing our work through this internship. Before wrapping up this post. There is a good reason why I insisted on choosing students from Geomatics department. I graduated from this department and I taught at it too. I have a strong claim to know its problems.\nWe are not discriminating other disciplines. (Certainly we are not disciplinists.) {: .notice\u0026ndash;warning}\nI highly encourage other big companies to try this out. I know that industry no long trusts academia (in Sudan). However, even in places where higher education is very robust, students also get to do internships. This is how things work. Unfortunately, educational institutions don\u0026rsquo;t have any plans on how to resolve this issue. They just throw their grad students away. It is no longer their responsibility. But let us just forget all that. It is as simple as this: industry needs good grad students. In order to have qualified students, they need to put what they were taught in practice. In our case, companies offers training positions instead of internships. The thing is, they are not the same: not in the job responsibilities, not in any aspect. Internships, on the other hand, offers those applicants a true job experience. That happens under a mentor, but still they got do more, and hence learn more.\nAnother aspect I\u0026rsquo;d like to mention is about undergrad qualifications. There are many incredibly talented and ambitions students. They are just waiting there for you to make the move. Giving them that chance, not only will help them in their career, it will also help you very much. Trust, they can do all kinda of crazy things.

Hosting all the course materials online can help our students a lot. They will find the materials of the course available 24/7. But that will also help us, too. As an instructor (for both G\u0026amp;I and UofK), I found it to be very time consuming to maintain a class. However, when we moved our works online, things have changed. The online forum accompanied with the website help students answer each others\u0026rsquo; questions\u0026ndash;that saved me lots of time, and helped the class understand the materials much better. Not only that, I found it to be much easier to respond to the class questions. Students know where to write their problems, I know where to find them. I now know what questions (what part of the class they suffer at it much), and how can I address such problems.\nDifficulties Good intentions are not enough. All of our work on this platform was to be open sourced. I was doing this project as a part of my work at G\u0026amp;I. Since, I have other things to do at gndi, and we really do not have much of resources to sponsor this project. I had to do it all by myself. But that was not also the biggest problem. I was so into this project that I was actually able to finish it all by myself in a very short time. Our biggest problem was the fact that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t fund its cloud costs. After that, I stopped working on it. To be honest our financial situation was very bad, and it was not meant to generate any revenue anyway, who would sponsor such a project? This why, even you have good intentions that should not be all you have. If you truly believe in your project, you have to seriously think of ways to secure its financial situation.\nGet funding for your open source project This is one of the main reasons to write this post. I needed to help anyone in the future to succeed in their open source applications. While I admire that you do it just because you love it/for fun. I still believe it is your responsibility to secure your open source financial resources. I think that is as important as making your program bug free. In both cases you cannot guarantee that, though you just try as much as you can.\nIn addressing this problem, I will try to make my suggested solutions as relevant to Sudan [my country] as possible, though some solutions apply to any place.\nKickstarter, it is very well known for this kind of projects. Notice that, in Kickstarter, you only taking funding just once. This should be ideal in cases where your biggest problem is the initial costs. [it has a technical term I forgot.] Gofundme. The same as Kickstarter. There are probably ton of these, some of them with similar ideas. You may try search for similar ones local to your region, you\u0026rsquo;d probably find funding much easier from them. What I really would like to highlight here is other type of donations that I believe to be much better than the one before.\nNational grants for research. This is usually sponsored by the Higher Education Ministry in each country. While in Sudan, it is quite uncommon to have such a grant (there is not actually), in almost all countries such grants existed. This how research is done anyway. This grant is usually covers many of your running costs and the initial costs too. You will probably receive the funding through different periods for a fixed amount of time.\nNot very different from the one before, you might actually find it much easier to get a grant from an institution that is close to what you are trying to build. In our case, we are currently trying to get a fund from the ministry of forests and (really long name). One of our projects happens to be similar to what the ministry was trying to do.\nYou can also ask people for donations, but you should not rely on it only.\nFinal marks Maintaining an open source project is not easy at all. One need to consider many factors. In this post I tried to highlight different ways to help you maintain your project.

These included:\nFurther development of Sharik\u0026rsquo;s mobile banking app, building on the KYC check feature to enhance security. Networking with SempoBlockchain and ConsenSys, leveraging these connections to gain recognition from MSX and SUI. Continuation of the project using blockchain and EMV chip technology to facilitate secure offline transactions in Sudan. These projects showcase my resilience and adaptability, as well as my commitment to leveraging technology to address pressing societal challenges. Sharik, Co-Founder and Tech Advisor, 2021-Present In my role as a Tech Advisor for Sharik, I provided crucial technical consultations to teams in Sudan. Despite the challenging circumstances of working in a country facing civil unrest, my expertise in software engineering allowed me to design efficient software solutions for surveying and data collection.\nOne of my significant achievements includes the development of an Android mobile banking app, built using the modern toolkit Jetpack Compose and Jetpack Compose experimental APIs. The app ensures easy and secure money transactions, catering to the fintech needs of the region.\nAdditionally, I developed a robust digital ledger software, written in Go and deployed on AWS. The software is designed to maintain solid backend financial records and uses technologies such as DynamoDB, AWS Lambda Functions, SES, and SNS for optimal performance.\nFor secure user authorization, I designed an authentication system using the Android Trust Platform Module. The system creates a public/private key pair, with the private key securely stored in the TPM. This method offers a higher level of security than JWT or other authentication methods, as it prevents the private key from being tampered with.\nIn collaboration with the World Bank and Catholic Refugee Services, I advocated for the launch of specific funding dedicated to Sudanese immigrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs) through our platform. This involved thorough meetings with the World Bank, spanning several hours, and the creation of detailed processes and procedures (both technical and non-technical). We provided factual figures to support our claims, leading to a successful collaboration.\nI also worked with 249 Startups, Sudan\u0026rsquo;s largest Venture Capital, to build a digital funds platform for their internal system. The platform tracks cash-based humanitarian aid and ensures a safe and secure way of transacting money.\nI leveraged my network to meet with the CEO of MSX, a prominent Abu-Dhabi based blockchain, and stable coin currency provider. I presented a convincing case for them to avail MSX currency in Sudan. The work is currently in progress and being carried out in partnership with 249.\nFurthermore, we had a successful meeting with SUI, a permission-less layer 1 blockchain, while working with MSX. I was able to present a strong case for both SUI and MSX to enroll us as a business partner.\nIn the midst of these projects, I continued to devote time and energy to our new mobile banking app, introducing a KYC check that uses ML-Kit to capture various compulsory KYC requirements such as face and ID verification.\nThese achievements were recognized by MSX and SUI, in part due to my previous networking with SempoBlockchain and ConsenSys, and the implementation of blockchain in combination with EMV chip to offer a secure way to do offline transactions in Sudan. Despite the challenges brought on by the civil unrest in Sudan, I was able to leverage my skills and experience to create impactful solutions and foster valuable partnerships.\n2021-NOW Tuti Tech Investment Co-founded and led the technical vision of Tuti Tech Investment, a cloud-based payment platform with cross-border operations\nBuilt and managed a diverse technical team, delivering innovative solutions for mobile, web and POS payments Ensured the technical and regulatory compliance of the platform, adhering to PCI DSS and financial authorities\u0026rsquo; standards Collaborated with business stakeholders and partners, developing proposals, presentations and projections for new opportunities Oversaw the social media strategy and soft-launch of the flagship payment app, generating user feedback and engagement As a Senior Software Engineer at Tuti Tech Investment, I had the privilege of leading the development and implementation of a groundbreaking solution that combined Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s blockchain technology with a Point of Sale (POS) network to offer offline transactions in conjunction with EMV chip cards. This innovative approach allowed us to address the challenges faced by individuals in areas with limited connectivity or infrastructure, ensuring secure and reliable transactions even in such circumstances. At tuti tech, I cofounded the company, built rigorous processs and workflows to ensure seamless work experience within different teams. grown the company from 1 engineer to 15 engineers, migrated myself legacy android java with multiple activities and xml views to jetpack compose, I also had tov work on as low level as getting to understand how jetpack compose implements listeners and how they have implemented the keyboard since we have our own secure and customised keyboard. On the backend, I also wrote the core backend system for the chat messaging, the system uses Redis for publishing and subscribing, and web sockets. we had ways to distribute the active clients and ensure online ones, ways to ensure message delivery, backing up messages in database in such a way to ensure offline users will \u0026ldquo;fetch\u0026rdquo; the messages when they are get back online and really lots of work to ensure that the chat works smoothly. another thing major contribution we worked on is an event driven system that uses streams. the streams are transactions streams for micorfinance system. the system fans out (sns topic on aws) fans out the subscriber varies, from lambda function (that does take the data to an internal dashboard system), an e-payment Microservices on SQS aws component that queues the transactions and relays them to an online switch system, an Microservices sqs system that connects to the core Microfinance system. They suggest to always quantify your skills, so include that I managed to increase technical team from 1 to 15 and by that I helped the organisation to cut time to market and by 2 quarters, i also managed internal and hire internal team to deliver an agency banking solution that only costs us 10K per 3 months, managed to convince the company we can do that as oppose of subscribing to a software from a company that they suggested it would cost $900K USD (by working with the CEO and CFO since I was CTO to align my team plan for the next year with the organisation objectives, I also managed to pull that off within our current resources and without affecting our running tasks, by smartly architecting our code to be reusable across different businesses). the chat service managed to give us an edge in terms of competitors, and also since we developed the systems internally we reduced substantial costs and another aspect is that we were not so sure about the business use cases of it so not putting a huge investment in it was good. A third thing is that the same code of the chat we created a library for it, open sourced it and reused it again in our platform to power other features (e.g., the chat for us is interesting in its realtime aspects and the web socket multi-way connection, so we used that for p2p direct payments where our users can create a qr and then the other user will scan it and via the library we can share all info including payment / transaction status) 2019-2021 Solus ltd after gauging sufficient traction for noebs via Linkedin, events, meetups, and word of mouth, it became next to logical to incorporate noebs and build a business around it, that was in the first quarter of 2019. We ran through hiccups in the start with failed partnerships, but in the end I managed to form a group of fully dedicated founders that believe in open source values and building a responsible company, down to in the company mandate we decided that the company would support unions AND also that our startup would have a package for employees benefits from stock options, to health insurance and supporting unions as well. Solus truly had opened my eyes to some aspects that being too technical and geek would cloud your judgement from seeing them. We hired an accountant, a secrteriate, and an advisor to the board. They were all seniors, part-timing with us but they brought in their stories. I learned to become a better human.\nSolus was truly a labor of love, we were 4 cofounders and 7 non-shareholders employees. Solus establishment coincided with Sudan\u0026rsquo;s revolution, the situation was truly bumpy in every way. Our seed was $10K and we had an agreement of a guaranteed funding of $100K in case we get the CBOS approval.\nWe get the approval from the first round, and that got us a recognition from the regulator for being the first vendor ever to pass from the first round of testing.\nOur open source system has became known to the regulator and we have had meetings with the Head of Electronic Payment Department discussing various aspects of our system: security, clarification as to why open source is the right approach for payment services, logging and retention periods, durability of the system logs, it was ultimately a great set of sessions where to my knowledge was the first time a fintech company was introduced to have these enlightening meetings with the regulator. Not far after that, the old regime had fallen, a coup and tragic massacare occured and internet was shut for several months across Sudan. That hit us deeply since we were just about to plan for our release of POS and app. Two of the cofounders have decided to leave, all of our team had left due to us unable to pay their salaries and I remained with a non-programmer cofounder, we only had our licenses and there was a sunk cost to it, we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to abandon it. Solus was truly a labor of love. I worked on the whole stack for 18 months, i was working on the backend core system with Go, i developed our dashboard using react, i added analytics and instrumentation using prometheus and grafana dashboard. I also took over our mobile app responsibility and the web portal (Angular). I was also using my social media accounts on Linkedin and Blog to attract customers to us. That helped us landed a client (Sudanese / Omani telecom provider) who was interested in having a payment system, they had old POS and they hired me (Solus, but actually me) to aim them integrate noebs APIs to their POS. With my previous POS experience and C and bit of Googling, we were able to get a working demo within a month. Challenges we faced:\nthe strict timeline, if we didn\u0026rsquo;t make a successful transaction within a month timeframe, we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to recieve our money\nthe pos had far more issues than they described to us\nthe pos tls stack was using ssl v3 which doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet PCI DSS\nas with the case with many POS providers, no support and little to no documentations\ntheir developer was all the way in Canada and the timezone was not really helping, but in the end and through a lot of wireshark sessions we were able to identifiy the problem was in the TLS handshake, so we started looking left and right and in the end we implemented tls from scratch in that ancient POS.\nAnother funny story is that the POS build can only happen in a windows XP, and they lost access to the SDK and the signature programs, so they have this sacred PC and when we started the development they had to send it from Oman to Canada.\nin the end we managed to get a successful demo, we got the contract and then Covid-19 hit. Again, the country had to put to halt for several months. The payment stopped, and everything stopped.\nDuring Covid i worked with the mininstry of health to build a rapid response system that links between the call center systems and the isolation centers (https://github.com/gndi/tracker), it is a PHP project and has interesting GIS features and analysis\nI also worked with Ministry of trading and industry on a design of a system that tracks the flour from the importers to the grinders and all the way to the bakery, the government was subsidizing flour and a lot of corrupt was happening (https://github.com/adonese/mit) i wrote the backend system, while the frontend was written by another team\nin the time i also worked as a freelancer and built some apps including a service app and a real-time ride sharing app. The realtime sharing app was using AWS infrastructure from DynamoDB, DNS and a fanout channel to mobile and sms and dashboard for call center.\nwe also won a bid for building a software for the ministry of petroleum to implement an enterprise management system for fuel stations. Essentially, the government was subsidizing fuel and they wanted to only subsidize a portion (e.g., 4 galons per car per month). So our proposal included a microcontroller device that would be connected to the dispenser, the microcontroller will be connected to our middleware and receives inputs from the POS regarding the owner (via their ATM card number, which we reverse look it to fetch the mobile number) and then the microcontroller will set the fuel recieved to the car given their monthly quota\nthe project was halted due to a political change in policies, they changed the whole ministries and eventually the new government decided to stop all of subsidation\ni grew interests in finding more angles to our business by offering saving and loan products by working with microfinance institutions (since banks stopped offering these products), that led me to be involved with COOP movement in Sudan. I was hosting all of initial meetings that led into COOP mandates in my office and we were brainstorming for months.\nUNDP got interested in our efforts and they suggested we join forces and that they can fund our coops projects At Solus, a very interesting technical project i led and worked on was this: we were working on building an offline-first payment system to help with areas in sudan where no internet access and or featured phones. Our solution involved leveraging the power of Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger for recording transactions. Smart contracts played a crucial role in defining the rules and logic for validating and recording each transaction securely. By utilizing Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s smart contract capabilities, we ensured that transactions were executed based on predefined conditions and automatically recorded in a tamper-proof manner.\nTo enable offline transactions, we integrated the POS network with EMV chip card technology. EMV chip cards, also known as chip and PIN cards, provide an added layer of security compared to traditional magnetic stripe cards. By incorporating EMV chip card technology into our POS system, we enabled users to conduct secure and encrypted offline transactions even in areas with limited internet connectivity.\nThe POS network acted as a bridge between the EMV chip cards and the Ethereum blockchain. When a transaction was initiated offline using an EMV chip card, the POS device securely stored the transaction data locally. Once an internet connection was established, the POS device connected to the Ethereum network and broadcasted the transaction data to the blockchain for verification and recording. This approach ensured that transactions could be seamlessly executed offline and later synchronized with the blockchain when connectivity was available.\nThe combination of Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s blockchain technology, EMV chip cards, and the POS network allowed us to provide a comprehensive solution for offline transactions. It offered users the convenience of conducting secure transactions using their EMV chip cards, regardless of their geographical location or the availability of internet connectivity. This solution was particularly valuable in regions with limited infrastructure or intermittent internet access, empowering individuals to access essential financial tools and services without limitations.\nI take great pride in this achievement as it showcases my ability to think innovatively, integrate diverse technologies, and create solutions that have a positive impact on people\u0026rsquo;s lives. It demonstrates my proficiency in blockchain technology, particularly in the context of Ethereum, as well as my expertise in POS systems and EMV chip card integration.\n2021 Working with UNDP and getting a long-term contractor with UNDP I worked as a fintech and tech consultant to UNDP. I worked as a consultant for UNDP Sudan to offer technical consultations for fintech and SACCOS (credit unions). My work involves reviewing policies, disk reviews, policies brief, and avail the findings in papers for roundtable discussions and presentations for various stakeholders. The technical part is about recommendations for the technical platforms for the SACCOS from SACCOS registration systems, integrations with other platforms (National ID system), to internal requirements to run SACCOS (ERP solutions, invoicing, and loan applications). The last part of the consultation is about using fintech to power the SACCOS and help with e-SACCOS in Sudan. That involves the technical requirements to integrate with payment processors, compliance and risk assessment, and building a reference implementation system for e-SACCOS loaning applications.\nAshrafcom: 2018-2019 i got a job at Ashrafcom as a python / backend developer Ashrafcom is one of the largest and oldest tech companies in Sudan Ashrafcom was the sole contractor to the government of Sudan to provide technonlogy solutions for collecting the government invoices, including taxes, customs, and VAS There was a huge organization mess when i joined ashrafcom: the company bought a payment system (Django based) from a prominent payment company from the UK the company didn\u0026rsquo;t have a tech staff to properly hand-over the software there was a mess everywhere, POS SDKs are not available, no proper code handover was implemented, vendors are there for the software and the hardware but no ones knows what were the problems so they could reach out when i first came, i was assigned to \u0026ldquo;make the core system works\u0026rdquo;, that was it! But in reality, there were plethora of problems that i had to see for the first time: deploying django, following best practices by using nginx and hosting static files in Amazon S3 setting up gunicorn for django and learning about letsencrypt \u0026ndash; i had to do all of that with only google provisioning for a payment system, we also have to connect with the Central Bank of Sudan Switch, that was also an area that i had no clue about in terms of setting up a VPN, ensuring a reliable connectivity, complying with the config requirements from Central Bank of Sudan and debugging connectivity issues. i used to do all of that, the actual coding and the follow up and communication with Central Bank of Sudan infrastructure department After setting up the platform, i was involved directly in the mobile app PCI DSS tests. We had to go through 10 rounds of testing in part, it was my first encounter with security tests i was doing two parts: fixing backend security issues and acting as a project coordinator to facilitate between Central Bank of Sudan Security team and the mobile development team after successfully finishing the app certification process and acquiring the license, i was then moved to work on the POS the pos had one big issue: there was no SDK documentations and the SDK we have had, had missing pieces (e.g., we didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to the POS printer SDK) it was sleepless nights, i didn\u0026rsquo;t have any experience with C language at all i had to get myself comfortable with the build environment, so that i could at least be able to get whatever code is there built and signed to the device. we had a large (thousands) of POS that was not working, and we only have part of the SDK without training and no documentations whatsoever, for example the POS SDK for the printer was not available! That was part of the challenge. Another dimension to it was that the source code was written by different teams and no control version OR code documentations was in-place, there were all sources of challenges and it made for such a great experience that horned not only my technical excellency, but also communication and management skills. We had shared lovely moments and i have seen the quirkiness of software at its best: one example is that the POS would fail in certain cases, i remember we figured this issue out as we were about to deliver the test POS to Central Bank of Sudan to test it, i was there in the car, my friend was driving and my first-thought was it could be a memory allocation bug. The POS was allocating just enough memory for the response \u0026ndash; and in a corner case, (e.g., a field called ResponseMessage returns a very long text when the Switch test server is down). So, as we were driving, i pulled my laptop and changed the server response in that issue to make the response smaller. we also had to implement http/1.1 protocol in the pos to send and manually parse json responses AND later migrated that mess by using libcurl and cJSON I was also assigned to start a project of moving our pos fleet to a different POS provider, to modernize our Linux-based POS and explore other options I was also responsible for fetching new POS vendors, prepare a short-list and arrange interviews with them to ensure that our hardware partners are solid and mitigate for any vendor lock-in. I had to take a break after a year at Ashrafcom, i learned a lot: Ashrafcom was a big enterprise, but they made sure that the software department is very flxeible and agile it was exciting technical issue, since i worked on various projects (in addition to the ones i mentioned, I was reporting directly to the CEO and he appointed me to review other software projects with the government and report on their status and progress, e.g., Flour project with the governemnt, Khartoum-state subsisdary project for commodities, Fuel subsidation project) it was also a great exposure to regulations, fintech industry and working with a large team i participated in interviewing candidates, setting up their job descriptions, preparing tech specs in contracts and when working with vendors, writing tech proposals, writing software requirements specifications i exercised with system architecture and system design and system design document for projects that are managed by other teams or delegated to out source companies. i left ashrafcom for personal ambitious to have my own business, but to this day i keep good contact with Ashrafcom and we even partnered in some projects. I left Ashrafcom in December 31. I took a hiatus for two months, the job at Ashrafcom was mentally stressing and affected my health. I started working on noebs: an open source payment gateway. noebs: 2018-Current noebs is a suite of open source projects and libraries to integrate with payment systems via standard financial systems protocols. The core of system is written in Go and includes the main system components, that are financial transactions via a consistent RESTful API layer. Noebs core has adapters to different financial system messages, but the focus was on TWO, Compass Plus Plus system with its ISO8583 (1987 version). It has adapters and supports to newer systems such as ISO20022 protocol. The design started with a simple library that interacts with Central Bank of Sudan switch with the aim to provide a SaaS solution that other companies can subscribe to and use. Noebs has grown in popularity and it now features: - SDKs for android and flutter - ecommerce plugin - POS integration - RESTful API layer to interact with the system components - Thorough documentations for system API endpoints - optional authentication framework layer - optional websocket to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions (we call them real-time payments) - dashboard for overseeing all system transactions - prometheus and grafana dashboard for system health reports and api endpoints metrics and general system instrumentation - verified linux image for in-house deployments, it includes a harnessed version of ubuntu that passes CBOS PCI DSS requirements - ansible scripts to automate the whole process of setting up a new noebs installation - noebs follows a classical 3 tier architecture, with an nginx reverse proxy doing the tls termination and load balancing, while noebs represents the logic tier, and we have a database. We believe that the three-tier architecture has proven to be very successful in this scenario, as it allowed for an organic growth of each of these layers without little to no interlapping between them. It also helped with the development of noebs itself, noebs became just a program, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care much about the persistent storage, nor does it do any logic regarding http, tls, authentication or whatsoever \u0026ndash; with that, as the requirements changed, we were able to hire people to work on the infrastructure part and later hired another engineer to work on the database / persistent storage layer, while all of them work asynchronously without blocking each others All of that had made noebs the largest open source project in fintech, with constant contributions since 2018. The project is adapted by different fintech companies in Sudan some of them I have had affiliation with whilst others have just found it more convenient to adapt it. I only use noebs exclusively for open source since a paid job would have conflicted with my employers\n2017 - NOW Geo and Innovation (G\u0026amp;I) / ACTS We rent a small office in ACTS (a highly reputable Telecom provider company, established in 1991). Inititally, the goal was to work as a software company and offer training courses to help us with the cash flow. To that end, we rent an office from ACTS a highly reputable Telecom company that got hit real hard by Huawei and Ericsson and they eventually rendered it out of business. We were very young and ACTS last remaining owners literally adopted us, to the point they didn\u0026rsquo;t take rent fees for the first 6 months. ACTS CEO and deputy believed in Software they tried before to pivot from hardware to software but they never succeeded. As the year passes by, ACTS seized its operation and their business was practically dead. We reached an agreement that led into me becoming one of the shareholders and that we can use ACTS name and brand. Using ACTS name has allowed to achieve great mutual benefits especially when working with NGOs - The initial goal was to offer specialized advanced training courses, including: - Excel for telecoms and government agencies - Programming courses (web development and Python) - GIS courses, including web GIS and using machine learning with GIS - Lead the company efforts to build a machine learning system to identify roads, buildings and other features from satellite imagery \u0026ndash; that was my first serious (and unfortunately last) encounter with machine learning. - i worked with models on theano and caffe to train u-map on available satellite imagery - we were able to sell a prototype to a company that was a contractor to Sudan\u0026rsquo;s National Intelligence. The goal was to \u0026ldquo;allocate military vehicles in areas in Western Sudan\u0026rdquo;. It was both exciting opportunity, since i was the tech lead of that project and also the main point of communication and business dev, but also was worrying in two aspects: - we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be involved with the military, we were rightfully scared to touch these areas - we were so desperate to land and opportunity that we didn\u0026rsquo;t mind to do it for free (under no legal contracts) - i was worried since the hardware and investment needed to train models on Airbus satellite imagery with 30cm accuracy, it was REALLY complicated from just infrastructure point of view, the storage, computation complexity and all of that. - i had to teach myself spark and hadoop just to have a grasp on what its like to deal with GB-scale data - we made a successful prototype, we were able to identify roads and buildings, and shared all of our findings and recommendations to the client (including our machine learning archetcture which was a modification on umap to handle satellite imagery AND tricks to handle the complexity of satellite imagery; they came with different bands and good care needs to be taken) - the client changes their requirements and the project halted as a result - we learned a lot and we were able to build a name for ourselves and better experinece to handle clients - I was responsible of preparing all tenders and proposals to NGOs, where i managed to land ACTS a contract with UNDP of more than $1M to become the implementer company for Sharik Project. - I also prepared and presented our portfolio as the main tech project lead for our Sandoog project with Mercy Corps. Sandoog is a saving group platform that empowers low income beneficiaries by giving them access to a simple mobile based app that they can use to create saving groups, manage them, and provide financial reports - so far, Sandoog doesn\u0026rsquo;t support epayment but the plan is to rollout epayment soon - I also prepared and highlighted the tech requirements for our proposal to land Mahsool project - Mahsool is a platform to empower small farmers by allowing them to: - using Sandoog to create a saving group that they can use to fund their farming activities - an online platform where they can get instant feedback about best practices and insights related to farming practices in their area - a platform where they can get access to market via it, a mini ecommerce where they can sell their products I\u0026rsquo;m focusing only in the NGOs, proposals, system design in my work at ACTS / G\u0026amp;I. I don\u0026rsquo;t active day to day tasks, but only as a contractor and advisor, in addition to my shareholder and board rights.\nin 2015-2018, in my 4th year in university, i with my colleague have created EEBAx, our services were two things: website design (we started with wordpress) and then moved to Adobe Muse and finally to write HTML / CSS directly) we didn\u0026rsquo;t make much money, but it was a good starting point in our final year, our graduation project was an android app, GeoidApp, which calculates very accurately using spherical harmonics, basically it helps to calculate a point height with great accuracy and almost zero costs. We participated with our graduation project (which then went on to win the best graduation project), in a nation-wide competition held by the British Council and we made it to top 10 projects out of thousands participants After that, in late December 2016, i finished my university got an engineering degree with the best graduation project and a record A+ and got admitted as a Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant in University of Khartoum. One of my department alumni suggested we could be partners with him in a software house / training center.
