      <description>There is nothing inherently special about love. But it is still there, it hurts us, it touches us deeper than any feeling there is.
I wish i could explain what love is, i wish i could find that right formula to show y&amp;rsquo;all that this is love. But i don&amp;rsquo;t think i have that answer nor that i&amp;rsquo;m interested to acquire that answer anymore. in life you are always just one step further from meeting their love of life.</description>

      <description>Relationships are hard to maintain. It touches very deep parts inside you, it makes you more insecure and usually more dumber. Relationships are hard.
It is extremely rare in nature to have two independently actors to align and to keep on that. It is often each partner in a different stage in the relationship than the other. The expectations change and so are the responsibilities. We are human and it is imperative we are insecure and subject to external factor.</description>
