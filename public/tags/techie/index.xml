Tech companies emphasized their own revenue over making the humanity better &amp;ndash; errr making its users better. And those incentives don&amp;rsquo;t align with what the actual users want.
For example, a keyboard software. Let&amp;rsquo;s say google&amp;rsquo;s GBoard. It is fantastic, it is smart enough to predict and corrects their typing mistakes.</description></item></channel></rss>
