The reponses i was swarmed with was nothing less than helpful and wholesome. Thanks a lot fellas.

What is life? What is the whole point? What is the point of living? This is not a question that i can answer, nor is it a warning sign about my mental situation. I&amp;rsquo;m good thank you. But, this mundane, routine thing is becoming extremely irritating. An important person to me used to say that they were a virtual person in the process to become an individual.</description></item><item><title>A mattress</title><link>https://adonese.sd/post/2022-01-14-a-matt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adonese.sd/post/2022-01-14-a-matt/</guid><description>I just noticed the single thing i have been dreaming to have is a matt. That is ridicluos i know, but I digged a little bit deeper to understand why.
Settlement. The reason i have been so focusing on the matt is that i truly wanted to settle, to have a home and the feeling that comes with it. But i couldn&amp;rsquo;t get anyone.
Now, i actually have the money to buy a matt, a nice lovely good one.</description></item><item><title>what is the point</title><link>https://adonese.sd/post/2022-01-05-what-is-the-point/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adonese.sd/post/2022-01-05-what-is-the-point/</guid><description>Sometimes i legit be wondering about life.

The truth is, i suck at keeping things around, i mean even if i want to, it is just so difficult for me to keep things.</description></item><item><title>A Date</title><link>https://adonese.sd/post/2021-10-22-a-date/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adonese.sd/post/2021-10-22-a-date/</guid><description>Just to confirm: i have dated before, i kinda did the whole process so i&amp;rsquo;m very well familar with how dates are practically been conducted. The only problem is i usually was more or less invited to the dates and that what is making things this complex.

A friend of mine (a bad one that actually thinks our governors are villain, screw you anti-progression), he was being summoned in response to his recent posts. Anyways, once he got there, he found his own posts were printed on money papers. Those were bloody valuable posts he got.</description></item></channel></rss>
