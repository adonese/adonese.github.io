      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about hiring. Also hiring&amp;rsquo;s nuts. i have listened to Mohamed Mudather&amp;rsquo;s video about hiring (Kutti is the CEO of Orooma, popular recruitment company in Sudan). One of the things he mentioned:
 you don&amp;rsquo;t have to have your guy at said company to hire you and companies are struggling to recruit candidates.  So, if that was the case, then why engineers and even great ones are struggling to get hired?</description>

      <description>i&amp;rsquo;m back to writing again. Hooray! Something&amp;rsquo;s been coocked aight?
Today i want to talk about a few things i hate about programming. Lots of enthusiastic programmers fall into this trap that is: ü•Åü•Åü•Å clean code! I don&amp;rsquo;t know of anything that is as subjective as clean code. You just cannot say whether this code is clean or not. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense at all.
java fuck java. Honestly, whenever i have a conversation with a java developer and no matter how senior they are it is always the same topics: best practices, clean code, and design patterns.</description>
