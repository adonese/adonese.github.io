You can also employ local firewall policies in your server (using ufw or iptables), but they are usually not that effective. This is a datacenter compliance problem! If your datacenter provider doesn’t have a firewall, then they violated PCI DSS #1 rule and you should change your datacenter. That simple!\nChange all default password on network connected devices\nDevil lies in the details. While this seemingly easy task to do, EBS security dedicates a huge pile of todos and what not regarding this simple one.\nWhat does this simply means is to change your default password for your server (that was assigned by the cloud provider). It goes further to basically change any vendor assigned password since these can be known to hackers.\nProtect stored card holder data Hmm. Interesting. What if you don’t even store them?\nOn the sending end, we do use TLS to encrypt our transactions between our servers (btw did you know ACTUALLY EBS USES SELF SIGNED CERT AND CLIENTS, LIKE US, HAVE TO SKIP TLS VERIFICATION WHEN CONNECTING TO EBS. Now you know.)\nStoring card holder data is tricky. We partially do it, albiet recommend against it very clearly in the app.\nEncrypt card holder data in transit Yeah, see above\nInstall malware protection WTF. WE use Linux. Maybe it makes sense if this rule were rewrote to something like this:\nEnsure that your backend services are run with a non-root user (e.g, if you are using docker it is more secure to run docker in a non root mode, by creating a new user and user group for docker. This way you gonna isolate your program and backend service from the rest of the system) Patch vulnerabilities This is really important and totally overlooked. In a retrospect, it goes against EBS certifcation process.\nLet us discuss what vulnerabilities are:\nwe have vulnerabilities in our OS we have vulnerabilities in our installed packages in our OS we have vulnerabilities in our programming langauge we have vulnerabilities in our libraries and frameworks we use in our programming language _This rule simply means, you have to regulary update your OS, update your OS packages, update your programming language version, and update your programming langauge libraries and frameworks (the one you use to write your hopefully PCI compliant system). But that also goes further to the client of this backend system, now here the shit gets real.\nWorking with clients or in this case POS devices and mobile apps is tricky. It gets extra tricky when working with POS devices, and devil’s level of tricky-ness when working with Linux-based POS devices.\nMajority of POS devices are using SSL. The good ones use TLS v1.1 which is permittable albeit not recommended. The recommended version is TLS v1.2 (which in itsefl is deprecated1). This is a huge problem since TLS or SSL v3 have really severe security impacts. The other annoying thing is that they actually affect the whole backend system security level as we have to support these devices!\nThe situation is like this (in our server):\nTLS v1.1, TLS v1.2, TLS v1.3 (WTF!) EBS:\nTLS v1.2 TLS v1.1 TLS v1.0 (FUCK)\nIt makes sense though, since EBS must have to support wide range of obsolete and insecure POS devices. Let’s just not ever again discuss EBS wound. It hurts.\nRestrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel You don’t need to restrict access to card holder data if you are not storing any of them. But in all cases, it makes sense to write this and consider it in the company’s process document.\nControl and restrict system access You bet.\nControl and restrict physical access to cardholder data Sure.\nMonitor access to data This is hard and it requires thinking (which way more harder actually, thinking sometimes lead to sinking). But practically speaking, a combination of rsyslog and sshd and /var/log/auth.log can help with that. Essentially what you want to achieve is that whenever someone attempts to access your server, you get notified via email. That’s monitoring. You can go all fancy and make a dashboard for that too.\nTest security systems regularly And this is where systems in Sudan fall short. No testing whatsoever have been done after the certification is issued and that is quite catastrophic. Can you imaging swiping your card in a system that has not been maintained for over couple of years (and even more!)\nMaintain an information security policy This falls in good suggestions yet no one cares! But it is important it is extremely important to maintain security policy and adhere to it. It should be part of the company process and manual. (An echo from the abyss that sounds: who listens WHO LISTENS!).\nCome again?
