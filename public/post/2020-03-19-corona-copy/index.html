<p>In effect, the country as a whole pretty much stops working. Let&rsquo;s close everything so that people won&rsquo;t get to meet with each others' (stop spreading the virus), and we can handle the affected cases.</p>

<h2 id="herd-immunity">Herd immunity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#herd-immunity">#</a></h2>
<p>You can read more on it on wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity,">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity,</a> but let&rsquo;s cite these excerpts from same wikipedia entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individual immunity can be gained by recovering from an infection or through vaccination</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some individuals cannot become immune due to medical reasons and in this group herd immunity is an important method of protection</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Because?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greater the proportion of individuals in a community who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune will come into contact with an infectious individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Herd immunity here means, we need to allow low risk samples (kids and youth mainly) to have Corona, while securing the high risky samples.</p>
<p>After two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>a percentage of our community will develop immunity to Corona</li>
<li>the risky sample will be kept isolated (quaranteed)</li>
<li>we won&rsquo;t be destroying our health system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gotchas">GOTCHAS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#gotchas">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>this method is extremely risk and it requires high level of discipline (Sudanese lack this feature)</li>
</ul>
<p>But, it might be a viable solution, think about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>the majority of population in Sudan are youth and even younger <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/sudan-population/">median age in Sudan is 19.7 years</a></li>
<li>locking down the country is really not a solution at all, you will need to lock down the country every two weeks if any new case is recorded! This will halt the country to the ground.</li>
<li>the exponential growth of corona cases is inevitable, but try to think again: what are you optimizing for? You cannot stop the growth of corona</li>
<li>overwhelming the health system will result in more catastrophic cases than corona itself</li>
<li>locking down the country will result in more catastrophic results than corona itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Sudan, we are in a different situation than the world. Our case is really different. Whatever the solution the government will adapt it needs to fit the data we have (Sudan case), using &ldquo;the rest of the world&rdquo; solution won&rsquo;t help.</p>
