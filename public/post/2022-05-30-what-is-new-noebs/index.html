That’s a lot of years especially in Sudan, software are rather dropped quickly.\nwhat is noebs? noebs is an open source payment gateway. Currently it implements all of EBS services, it supports both EBS Merchant Web Services and Consumer Web Services. It also comes with a built-in support for the new Dynamic Fees model. We also support QR services and the new Merchant Web APIs. In that, I know of none that actually have such thorough level of coverage and actively being developed. So yaaay to us!\nnoebs v1 We are not there yet, I wish I could say that, but we are not there yet. Let’s get back a bit and understand what we were initially thinking of when we started this project.\nwe want to change the payment landscape Originally, noebs was meant to act as a unified payment gateway for all of EBS services. However, we realized that we need to separate the services into different sets: consumer and merchant. They vary slightly in terms of fields, but we made a good progress into fixing that.\nWe wanted to both be compatible with EBS APIs, and at the same time make a unified interface for their two rather varying APIs.\nThat doesn’t really work at all in practice: we had to make a tradeoff, either sticking to EBS APIs or building a shim layer on top of it. We opted to become fully compatible with EBS.\nthe database I hated this part the most. We were using gorm v1 and the SQL code we wrote was ribbish. One of the biggest changes we introduced was upgrading to Gorm v2. At least, we now at least migrated to gorm v2. I’m less embarrassed now.\nnoebs API noebs APIs have been stable since the first release in 2019. We have not changed any API since then. I don’t think we will change that status. Though we should.\nAPI improvements So far, we don’t manage sessions or authentication. We are delegating this task to the consumer of noebs to deploy however authentication system they like. I still feel this is the right way of doing things. There are infinite ways of rolling out an authentication server, and in certain cases, payment companies, hide their authentication server behind a VPN. I don’t think we will change anything about that, at least not in the public noebs repo.\nSecurity We are yet to perform an auditing in noebs. It is expensive to be honest and we are relying EBS tests we have passed to be our security baseline.\nareas that need improvement Fix our gRPC layer, it helps a lot in integrating with noebs Complete our SDKs: we have Java, Dart, and JS, but we need to add more languages especially WordPress and PHP and their plugins. Unit testing noebs is a non-trivial task and it needs to be done before we can claim we have a noebs V1 product… But that is challenging. But, what i really want to address is the deployment..\nnoebs deployment Currently, noebs is only as useful as the connectivity of EBS is up. If e.g., EBS QA merchant server is down, we are on our own. I have been vocally reluctant to add mocking endpoints to noebs source code. It will just make the whole code messy, and will make it far more harder to document the code. The code will be hard to maintain. I don’t like that approach.\nIdeally, what I’m thinking of is of this sort:\ngraph TD D[local]--Accessible--\u003e A D-.Not accessible.-\u003eB D==VPN?==\u003eB A[noebs] --\u003e|VPN| B(EBS Endpoints) A[noebs]--\u003e H(Redis) B --\u003e F{fa:fa-laptop EBS Consumer} B --\u003e G{fa:fa-server EBS Merchant} We don’t have an access to EBS directly, and as a result it is rather difficult to perform any integration tests. As we are heading towards the 4th year of noebs, I believe we are more closer than ever to have a V1 product.\n","wordCount":"666","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-05-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-05-30T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://adonese.sd/post/2022-05-30-what-is-new-noebs/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"adonese's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://adonese.sd/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://adonese.sd/ accesskey=h title="adonese's Blog (Alt + H)">adonese's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://adonese.sd/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://slides.adonese.sd title=Presentations><span>Presentations</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://adonese.sd/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://adonese.sd/bio title="Bio and Resume"><span>Bio and Resume</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What are we cooking in noebs</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-05-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>May 30, 2022</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>noebs is couple of yours old now, actually next October it will complete its 4th year.
