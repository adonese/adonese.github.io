We have /rate feature which allows our users to get the USD rate of today Thanks to the folks of price today. I will just go through how we implmeneted this feature and what we can learn from that.\nmake it works for GODâ€™S sake! it is of zero use to discuss about any fancy api design when the functionality is not working!\nThis part is quite easy, we used of go x/html stuff to parse www.price-today.com/currency-prices-sudan. Parsing was quite straightforward:\nwe iterate through html tag that contains our fields match against our hardcoded values (representing the fields we want) final round of clearing the text and parsing the strings to floats Now, it actually works, whenever we call this function we get a result. And it is mostly the same result, every time.\nWe shipped the code as it is.\nit works, letâ€™s enhance it This system has a problem, everytime a userâ€™s hit /rate we make an external http call to the currency website. And we parse it too. The external http call is quite expensive, and we donâ€™t want to bloat our good folks with unnecessary traffic. Cache it.\nThe idea is we want an in-memory caching that allows us to store and retrieve data. It should also invlidates the cache. We found a third part go library that offers a nice caching api.\nOur caching stopped working! TESTING TESTING TESTING\nLetâ€™s enlist the dependancies to see where things could possibly go wrong:\nwe are relying on an external caching library we are relying on an external provider (for currency rate) we have also refactored the code to make the rate service an external grpc endpoint. Things are getting pretty tough now.\nDonâ€™t optimize twice Thereâ€™s no rule for this and it seems quite arbitrary actually. In procedural linear systems catching bugs is really simple! You just traverse through the program until you hit that line that breaks and then you fix it.\nWhen hitting /rate, this happens:\nwe query the cache service to see if we have any valid values, if yes we use this value and we are all set ready ðŸš€. if not, we: call the rate function retrieve the value and update the cache get the value from the cache Since rate service will be used by different clients on our stack, we find that it makes sense to refactor it and make it a grpc endpoint, so now we have:\nwe query the cache service to see if we have any valid values, if yes we use this value and we are all set ready ðŸš€. if not, we: call the rate grpc endpoint retrieve the value and update the cache get the value from the cache You can see that we copy-pasted the previous listing.\nNow, we can use our rate service from different platforms without rewriting it over and over.\nBut none of that fixed the problem.\ntesting is vital for software Software is intrinsically broken, and the moment you realize that you stop trusting everything, and most importantly YOU!\nOur external currency provider has changed their html which break all of our parsing logic. We fixed it.\nrevisiting the design The rate service was a good decision. It will allow for this service to grow independantly from the rest of the system, while being used by different clients. In cashqbot, it was like 100 LOC, but what if we want to add more currency providers? What if we want to handle different currencies than just USD (this will likely result in breaking current implementation). It can also decide to maintain the api for these clients, while having another one. The possibilities are endless. It can grow too much that containing it in cashqbot requirements. And software always grows. Containment is wrong. Embrace its complexity and let it grows without affecting other parts. Let it grow independently.\nlibrary and the clients Libraries are made to handle the general case, their clients should accounts for the special cases. The design of rate service is quite simple:\nit uses grpc protocol it gets the result with error if available It is the responsibility of the client to implement the protocol and to handle the errors. But, what about caching the results? It is the client responsibility to handle the results. rate service doesnâ€™t care about this, it just gets a (float32, error). Adding the cache there is completely hurtful â€“ and I see lotâ€™s of people do that. The clients are responsible for implementing this logic. And this is the gist of this post.\nrate limiting cashqbot has a go routine that handles the limiting service, the logic is quite simple:\nget the result and store it in a package level variable a ticker channel that activates every [TIME] at each time it activates, we update that variable by connection to rate service our bot rate handler becomes like this: // it is not exactly this way, but it is the gist of it func rate() float32{ return myGlobalRateVariable } Results We have refactored the rate function into a new rate service that is exposed over grpc endpoint. The new grpc service can grow in complexity while not affecting other system components and maintinaing backward compatibility We have hugely simplified bot rate handler The rate service is not tightly coupled to any clientâ€™s specifications We hardened our tests for the rate service parsing logic ","wordCount":"947","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://adonese.sd/post/2020-01-15-refactoring-and-debugging/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"adonese's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://adonese.sd/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://adonese.sd/ accesskey=h title="adonese's Blog (Alt + H)">adonese's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://adonese.sd/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://slides.adonese.sd title=Presentations><span>Presentations</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://adonese.sd/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://adonese.sd/bio title="Bio and Resume"><span>Bio and Resume</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How to design libraries</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2020-01-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 15, 2020</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>This post is about how to design libraries.
