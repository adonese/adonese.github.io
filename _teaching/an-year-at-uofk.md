>I've always dreaming of teaching.

I worked as a teaching assistant at University of Khartoum, Geomatics Engineering department. I've TAed different classes--mostyl computational/programming ones. It was very nice experience, I couldn't be more happier. Though, I have some notes.

### National Service

The national service is the single most evil, human rights violation has ever been done. Our governers are literally using us to cover for their economical failure. The national service is a one year that each graduate student should serve in military. Usually, people prefer to do their national service in non-military places. That was exploited pretty well bad by the government sector.
In my case, I wasn't physically fitted to do my national service in a miliant facility. Luckily, I met all the requirements to be accepted at UofK.

### About Teaching
In my first semester, I have TAed [Phyiscal Geodesy](https://sites.google.com/view/se522), 5th year students; [Adjustment Computations](https://sites.google.com/view/se412), 4th year.
I'm do not intend to write a detailed post about each class, I might do that later.

* I think that physical geodesy is the _toughest_ class ever. Students find huge difficulty in understanding the class materials. I've tried to ease the course by adding more programming exercises. E.g., the class project was about building a program to compute the geoid.

* <strike>Most of students suffer much in mathematical intensive classes. I suspect that might be because the way courses are offered: You don't get to choose what courses you want to take. </strike>

* Many of mathematical classes are poorly taught. They are not _engineering math_.
