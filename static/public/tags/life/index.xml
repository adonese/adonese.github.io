      <description>Money&amp;rsquo;s paper is a special type of papers that only used by authorized companies. It is typically used in the company&amp;rsquo;s official documents e.g., contracts.
A friend of mine (a bad one that actually thinks our governors are villain, screw you anti-progression), he was being summoned in response to his recent posts. Anyways, once he got there, he found his own posts were printed on money papers. Those were bloody valuable posts he got.</description>
