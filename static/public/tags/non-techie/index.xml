      <description>The fact i still have my ex&amp;rsquo;s gifts is nothing short of a surprise to me. i still have:
 her mug a lovely backpack an oracle speaker pocket shoes jalabya على الله  Up until a few days ago, i kept a present i was meaning to give it to her (though i didn&amp;rsquo;t), before i gave to a friend. The truth is, i suck at keeping things around, i mean even if i want to, it is just so difficult for me to keep things.</description>

      <description>Just to confirm: i have dated before, i kinda did the whole process so i&amp;rsquo;m very well familar with how dates are practically been conducted. The only problem is i usually was more or less invited to the dates and that what is making things this complex.
Why dating has became more difficult? Or, is it just me? Well, this really and truly is a personal issue, but one way of reasoning about the issues i ran into &amp;ndash; the bugs, is by speaking them out loud (usually to myself or with a colleague / friend, but you gotta do what you got.</description>

      <description>Money&amp;rsquo;s paper is a special type of papers that only used by authorized companies. It is typically used in the company&amp;rsquo;s official documents e.g., contracts.
A friend of mine (a bad one that actually thinks our governors are villain, screw you anti-progression), he was being summoned in response to his recent posts. Anyways, once he got there, he found his own posts were printed on money papers. Those were bloody valuable posts he got.</description>
