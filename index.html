I'm trying to do something useful. To learn a new thing, to excel at another. I'm a <em>geek</em> in its broad meaning. I care about news, and what happens around me. Sometimes, people do bad things, I do not like to let such things go. I ought to stand against such things.

I currently work on applying deep learning in remote sensing. We are workin on building models to better understand the ever increasing satellite imagery. One of my motivations behind this work is to enhance the quality of maps in Sudan. More on our work on this field very soon.
