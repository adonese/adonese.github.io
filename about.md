Hi, my name is Mohamed Yousif and I'm a software developer! Welcome to my blog. So, let me introduce myself to you in a rather short way. In the last several years, I worked exclusively on payment systems. I founded a startup working in electronic payment and is licensed from Central Bank of Sudan as a Payment Service Provider. I also have an open source payment gateway solution that is well adopted by the community in Sudan and has corporate support from several entreprises.

I'm a software engineer with several years of experience in different industries and different roles: from a research assistant building stuff on Matlab and numpy, to a web developer for a telecom company. I have been lucky enough to work on different technologies and languages ranging from Flutter and Dart to machine learning models and web services.

I'm also geek. Computers are my hobby after all.

## Experience

### Currently

I'm working as a consultant for UNDP Sudan. I'm consulting for a financial technology (Fintech) role where we are working to build the necessarily legal and institutional framework for SACCOS (also known as Credit Unions), and build the supporting technology infrastructure to help power those institutions, so far we have completed:
- Framework for how SACCOS and COOPS will work, in particular:
    - Each SACCO will be eligilible to register under current Sudan's law (as non-taking deposit microfinance instiution)
    - A SACCO will have a wallet to store its capital, via one of our partner banks
    - SACCO members will be eligilible to have a saccoID which is a fully qualified bank ID identifier (virtual bank account), that they can use to transact fund
    - A SACCO will also have a bank account for their wallet
    - Another platform will be used to utilize the Digital Identity we have
- A proposed legal framework for SACCOS: this has been the majority of the first phase of the project where we discussed previous experimentations in other countries, including Kenya, Rwanda and Tenzania. That part was wildly rewarding as it allows me to dive deep into regulatory sides of things.
- We also proposed a management structure for said SACCOS. That manual includes how a SACCO can be formed, the minimum requirements for its members, and how their internal structure and processes goes. This is extremely important since a SACCO is subject to loan from its members (and later external entities), so the part of accounting and tracking loans applications, and risk assessment and how collateral is handled is of an extreme importance.
- Manual for Trainings (SACCOS TOT Manual): this includes 7 modules to train potential SACCOS members on:
    - Financial literacy 101
    - Legal requirements to form a SACCO
    - Legal requirements to be a certified SACCO (by the Sudan's Coops' Registrar)
    - Accounting and Finance policy module: that discusses payment orders, how to use SACCOs ERP system and ways to use paper if the system is not available
    - Know Your SACCO module that deals with dealing with loans and repayments
    - Agricultural Loan Products module: deals with practical products that a SACCO can offer to grow their businesses, Sudan is an agricultural state
    - Entreprnuership overview: it discusses Entrepnuership and how it can relate to COOPs and SACCOS
- Open source projects:
    - Coops registration platform
    - SACCOS CORE System:
    This is actually is unique in that one of our initial goals was to utilize SACCOS in order to sustain the COOPs ecosystem. We believed, even if we were able to legalize COOPs and SACCOs in Sudan, unless we empower them with the necassirly tools, relying on donors won't help sustain them for long. The system allows for these functionalities:
        - A centralized platform to register Coops and SACCOs
        - Mini ERP system to be used internally by SACCOs and COOPs
        - Payment integration system to handle the transactions between different entities (SACCOS and COOPs) via the Unified saccoID (for both Coops and SACCOS)
        - SACCOS mobile app. It is a simple wallet app that allows members to inquire about their balance, transfer fund, topup their telecoms, and most importantly apply for loans and do repayments.

This is more or less what the initiation stage of the project was. The next stage would be implementing and launching several SACCOs as well as the digital services.


### Solus (2019-2021)

I founded Solus in 2019 as a fintech company. Payment market in Sudan was quite flourishing in 2019 before the revolution and the events that transpired afterwards. I took the role of a CTO, but since we were quite a small company (6 engineers at most), I was more or less a Software Engineer. 

Solus is really a good example that with dedication, miracles can ravel. We started Solus with 14000 SDG (that is around $300). It was just the money I were able to afford from my salary saving from my previous employer. That allowed me to work with my cofounder (Mohamed Jaafar) to build noebs and Cashq, while Amjad (our third shareholder) helped with getting some friends to split the office rent and allowing us to basically pay as low as 1000ish per month. Solus later was valued at more than $200K. I'm currently not working at Solus.

We got the backend system and app (both are now open sourced) done quite soon, and we were later joined by Dr. Tilal (acted as a CEO and a shareholder). 2019-2021 were not the best times to start a business in Sudan, we had revolution, internet were cut for more than 3 months, we didn't have a government for several more months, and later the pandemic hit.

### ACTS & Geo and Innovation & EEBAx (2014-?)

Well, I founded EEBAX <https://eebax.de> back in college dorm with my colleague Mohamed Jaafar (also my partner in Solus). We were majoring in Surveying Engineering (both of us), but we were both trying to skip that and shift our careers to Software. Long story short, after we graduated, we were hired by the deparment to work as teaching assistant and research assistants, we met Amjad Abdeen (a master's student at that time), and he saw we had a good potential so he offered we join him to make a new company that offers both engineering services and software services. And we founded Geo and Innovation for that reason!


### Internships and some gigs

- I worked for Global Aid Hand (2014) as a GIS engineer (mappings and web maps)
- I worked for Getmattech as a software developer (2013)
- I worked for Save the Children (2015) as a web developer

## Publications and speaks

- You can find my published BSc thesis here, <https://github.com/adonese/graduation-project>
- Some of presentations are here: <https://slides.adonese.sd/>

## Prices and misc

- 2020: Top 50 Tech Leaders, InterCon
- 2017: Mashrouy IV Best 12 Project

## Programming languages and roles

- Proficient in Go, Python, and backend development in general
- Proficient in payment systems and protocols, ISO20022, ISO8583, switch and online systems, Core Banking Systems and so
- Web development: vanilla js, react (kinda), angular (kinda), Svelte (kinda), WASM
- Mobile development: 
    - android / Java (i want to eventually learn kotlin and migrate to JetPack)
    - Flutter / dart: i like Dart, but i have opinions on Flutter. Used flutter to build a service on demand app that includes: geolocations, websockets and realtime communications, orders, etc, as I was learning the language
- C / C++: in a very small capacity, just some counters on one of the POS devices i worked on
- I'm quite excited about TypeScript and Rust, i would love to work on a position where I will get to maintain or write a code that uses them
- I like Zig and also elixir and phoenix but I'm yet to find a time to work on them
- I have quite improved my knowledge about databases, but I'm yet to learn more too

### As for the roles:

Currently, most of the job offers I got are for CTO roles, probably because of my experience in my own startups, but also might be because of the lack of developers in Sudan

- CTO
- Business development
- Software engineer (Backend)
- Software engineer (web)
- Software engineer (mobile)
- Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist
