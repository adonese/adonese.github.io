Designing a software program that can work efficiently very well, and testable in that new features and enhancements can be added to it is a bit of work. The way I approach can often be labeled as a _lazy_ or naive way. That is a fair statement. I believe a good design is the simple one. And in order for you to have a simple design, that would be an iterative work. So you need to start from somewhere and then iterate on it. I believe it is always better to start from a place where you are very comfortable at. Start with REST apis as oppose to gRPC, a single server as oppose to kubernetes. That well serve as a good proof of concept and will provide you with first hand exposure to the problem at hand. And sometimes requirements changes and for startups POC is always prefered over a full blown solution. By then, you would have more clarity about the problem and its interactions too. You will become more adept to the problem nuances and that will help you enhance your next iteration with more context about the problem. Computers are really fast and in most of the cases you don't really need kubernetes, nor a 3-pager AWS architecture.
