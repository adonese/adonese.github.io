If you know me any better you'd know that I have been yearning for a mattress for quite sometime now, wrote a blog post about it even 2 years before. And i have been grinding to fix it 2 years prior to that. I have never really fixed it, i know the solution: just buy a damn mattress. Side quests and side battles are important to give you some long due rests and rare sense of victories. Post war I had to abruplty leave my apartment and likewise Sudan. It possessed new challenges for me: i lost everything on a blink of an eye and some 10 months later I'm yet to fathom the full scale of that. I have been finding myself occupying my time with some odd activities nonetheless: extra coding, walking for hours, and amongst all having those white-fights with my roommates, who's tasked to do chores, run errands etc. The fights in particular are quite a thing though: not only do they allow me to peacefully channel out anger, but they also serve as a purpose. To have those rather win-full battles where no harm can be inflicted and they are a good source for cheap testosterone too.

I didn't fix my matt yet, I do not want to buy a pillow either: not a self-harm act at all. And i have minor fights with my roommates. All of these to keep me busy from fighting my real demons.
