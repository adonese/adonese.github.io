excerpt: You get to live through someone else's lenses
title: On reading
---

If you ever have a secret book, a secret twitter / facebook account or a blog. A secret place you share your VERY own stuff, please by all means I would be the happiest into being one of your readers! I love reading people's thoughts. This is really the only thing i do so passionately and brings in about huge joy to my life. Books, articles, twitter-shitposting-accounts, whatever that medium that shows that encapsulates the you you! It is amazing and it is one of my sincerest hobbies.


There's something about writing that people often overlook. It gives a transparent view onto one's very heart. It allows you to live through someone else's minds, eyes, and brains!
