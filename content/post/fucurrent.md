Thinking too far ahead about one's life while advisable can often yield wrong outputs. A simple strategy would be to diversify your portfolio and invest in a variety of things. Investment here is not strictly financial: time and your own effort are also investments. You don't know what will gonna happen in the next five years from. A good example for survivorship bias to say.

We don't have that crystal clear view, the magic the unravel the future and the secret of the universe.

The so many friends who left Sudan earlier and succeeded, the so many who completed masters and succeeded, the so many who got married and started a family and all of that. Those are legit and valid cases, but they are also the survivors. I cannot see a silver lining to any of these and there's quite a no-path to follow. Loose instructions and mere hints.

Diversify your risk, follow your guts and treat yourself. No one knows anything, you get to be the director, the storyteller and the actor of your own very story. You set the narrative.

Bend but not break, I guess.
