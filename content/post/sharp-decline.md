Since December 19th, 2023 (the fall of Medani) i couldn't at all picked up on coding, or doing any career-related activities. Impulsively tried to work super hard in the next week post Medani fall just to escape from all of the worries and fears and laser focus on my <https://nil.sd> work.

I have always been excellent on isolating my work from my life. I recall I was hesitant to take couple of days off to attend my late grandma funeral back when i was TAing at uofk. I went to the dean and he told me i was not supposed to come _that_ earlier and I could have taken some extra days off.

Different people respond to shocks in various ways. Mine is a tricky one in that i don't feel the shock spontaneously, i don't crumble immediately under the weight of adversity or pain, it takes me a while to fully comprehend the magnitude of the situation. And then the full impact starts to hit all at once and a door to hells unfolds.

Don't be ruthless unto yourself
