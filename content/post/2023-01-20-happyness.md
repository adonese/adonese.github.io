excerpt: it is so easy to dwell into our most darkest selves while ignroing all of
  the beauty in our lives.
title: love life

In a retrospect i love life, i have so much love to give and so much stories to tell. i have so many roads i wanna tap into and so many feelings that i yet to experience. Whilst the situation might not really encourage the message this post is trying to relay -- and it might as well seems so off to the point it is irrelevant, given the economical situation we are in at the moment. I still believe there is a spot for being happy. We often tend to amplify sadness and bad feelings in general, while totally ignorning any ray of happiness.

it takes a huge effort and mental state to fight all the odds and force yourself into feeling better. Being negative is not a synonymum to being cool.
