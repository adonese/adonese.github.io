I have not written any post recently (4 months since my breakup post). I want to use this article to discuss some of the ideas i have about "work", and by work i mean professional work. I won't be citing anything (at least for now since i'm using this post to get away from working so yeah), so take everything here with a hugge grain of salt. 

Corona has changed a lot and many of big software companies have moved to a permanent remote work setup. That actually makes sense as software can be done remotely and for that we have really built awesome infrastrucutre supporting this: from email, to Slack and Zoom. Everything we do in software is inherently remote-friendly. 


### 9 - 5

Work has become a lifestyle and a fundamental part of our daily routine. 9 - 5 is extremely arbitrary; it has nothing to do with peak performance time nor backed by any efficiency measure. It is no surprise that _peak performance_ times varies from someone to other. But, regardless, we have be somewhere between 9 - 5; it would be weird to stay at home at such.

But again, what work really is?

What if i don't want to work.

You need to work, because:

- you need to pay your bills and the necessary expenses
- you have to build a career
- your career can support you when you finally retire

There is a theme there. All of these listed items are _basic human needs_. You are not asking anything more than food and a place to live under!

So why bother, why should i work?

### Universal Basic Income


From wikipedia:

>Basic income, also called universal basic income (UBI), citizen's income, citizen's basic income, basic income guarantee, basic living stipend, guaranteed annual income, or universal demogrant, is a theoretical governmental public program for a periodic payment delivered to all citizens of a given population without a means test or work requirement.[1]
