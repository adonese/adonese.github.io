We are very pleased to announce new internships at _gndi_.
>G&I (_gndi_ for short) is a tech company that provides a wide range of geospatial solutions and services for corporates and for individuals as well.

## Why is that?
This initiatives came as a response to one my [posts](../2017-10-28-an-year-at-uofk/). Clearly there is a problem in our system. _There is no systematic way of getting a job_. Every year, tons of peoples are graduating from colleges. Industry cannot cover this number of graduates.

## Internship programs

The internship period is three months. Our interns will work on various projects. Here are just a few examples of some the things we might do (also listed here for others to work on)

* Building a visualization tool for geodesy. Just to make things simple, we will only focuss on the materials from Ahmed Abdalla's lecture notes and Rapp's.
* GPS on Android. Seems to be easy peasy? Well, let us see.

* Articles in Geomatics Engineering, tutorials, how-tos, etc.


All of our works will be open source and freely available for anyone to use and contribute. However, that is not even the best part. We, and this very awesome interns will work together to give back. We will be giving workshops and tutorials on these technologies-basically everything we believe to be useful for Geomatics Engineers. We are also creating Geodesy Study group. We have many reasons as to why this study group is important. We need people to _understand_ geodesy and thereafter apply it.
