I have long since I lost the taste of days. Maybe it is just an age thing and Sudan is also too much. I often would find it too hard to recall what a day in a week we are, and in many cases I would find myself wondering it is actually Wednesday. 

Weekends are my chill although I must say, I still find a reason to not chill. I only learned to say "Enjoy your weekend" quite late in my career in 2019, for me weekends were the bestest times you could achieve more in your tasks.

To think that your life as a whole is defined by your career, that's just pathetic.
