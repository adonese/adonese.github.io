I worked with some Non Government Organizations (NGOs) for some time, not too much to draw any conclusion, but long enough to get to notice some patterns. They are all seem to be well spoken, smart, and have it figured out. They know what they are doing, and they all have this same _accent_, for the lack of a better word.

The problem when we all have the same perspective, the same way of thinking, the books method. That very structured way of thinking make it very hard to make breakthroughs, and, well, address problems that has not been address before. Addressing new problems is the core function of most of ngos since they deal with community problems, and community problems are always changing and quite very hard to model.

Changing the accent is also very important as ngos are addressing problems with  moving dynamics and it is important to adjust for that. New voices, new perspectives, gives new methods to address and tackle complicated variables. 

**Last note** the top-bottom model of management and hierarchy is quite unfit for the cases where assumptions are to be always challenged, and for when the problem is not linear in its variables. A system with more dynamics, that can grow and shrink as needed, their responsibilities as well as their duties can change as the requirements change.
