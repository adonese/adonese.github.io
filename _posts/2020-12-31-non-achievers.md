So it is a new year, huh? You suddenly find your friends achieving really cool things and you feel like you have not done any thing. This post is for you, for US.

I don't that life is a discrete function and treating it that way won't help. Success is not linear, in the journey of your life you will have far more failures than your successes. 

Take a break, if anything. Enjoy the little things and continue on what you are doing!

It is OK to *not* achieve any thing.
