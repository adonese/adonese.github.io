Or really, publish or perish.


Let's set the stage for this: you don't have to learn a new thing every day. You don't have to produce a fancy thing every day and you definitely don't have to be at your best every day. People are humans, and humans by nature have their ups and downs.

Chill, take some time off. Enjoy the little things, get away from your laptop. You are not a robot. God, even machines perform much better after a reboot.

The notion that you have to _produce_ something new, something fancy every day is nonsense and shouldn't be tolerated. If you feel down, take a day off. If you feel overwhelmed, take a step back and maybe come back later.

Burnout is real. Don't optimize for the short goals.
